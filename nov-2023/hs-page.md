title: "High School Election Page Training & Quiz for the November 2023 Election"
---

Fairfax County has an election page program for interested high school students to serve at a polling place on election day. For more information, visit: [https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/elections/high-school-student-program](https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/elections/high-school-student-program).

On October 3, we will conduct a live online training for all student pages. The training is approximately 90 minutes and includes a question-and-answer session. After reviewing this training, pages must complete a quiz. The quiz link was emailed to all individuals who submitted an application before the deadline.

<h2><span style="color:red;">The training recording will be published on this page on Wednesday, October 4.</span></h2>

**The training quiz was emailed to all pages. The quiz link is customized for each page so we can automatically update your record.**

For questions, contact Page Program Coordinator Beth Dixon Methfessel at beth.methfessel@fairfaxcounty.gov or 571-363-0225.
