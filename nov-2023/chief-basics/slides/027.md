What should you do if a voter is already listed in the pollbook as having voted earlier in the day?

- This may have happened if one of your officers checked in someone manually with the wrong name. For example, **Bob Voter, Jr.** arrived to vote, but was checked-in as **Bob Voter**.
- Unless both voters are present, do NOT edit the previous check-in.
- Instead, offer the voter a provisional ballot.
- Voter and officer fill out the "Non-Same Day Registration" side of the provisional envelope.

The Electoral Board will review the situation and determine if the ballot should be counted.

To prevent this kind of situation from occurring, emphasize to your officers to take time to verify that they are selecting the correct voter, especially if there are voters with same or similar names. It is OK to ask the voter some clarifying questions.
