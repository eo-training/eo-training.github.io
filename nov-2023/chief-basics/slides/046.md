This is a sample of the Provisional Ballot Log.

For each provisional voter, you will record some basic information about them here, including their name, address, year of birth, and phone number. The voter writes this information on the individual provisional envelopes, so you can simply copy it over. To keep track of voters entered on the log, put a check mark on the provisional envelope for that voter.

You must also select a numerical reason code for each provisional voter - these are the same as the codes listed on the provisional envelopes.

Your paper Provisional Ballot Log will serve as a backup to the digital log you must also complete. It is stored in the "Emergency" materials envelope in the black kit; only use it if the electronic log is not working.
