What should you do if a voter is not listed in the pollbook?

- First, try doing an advanced search on the Poll Pad to try to find the voter by their date of birth, address, or other identifying information.
- If you still can't find the voter, call the Office of Elections. It may be an error and the office may give you instructions on how to add the voter to your pollbook, or they may determine that the voter is not registered in Fairfax County.
- Determine if the voter is eligible to do a Same Day Registration at your precinct and if so, follow the SDR process outlined in the Chief's Notebook.
- All Chiefs are required to take the SDR Basics training class and to pass the quiz. The class is posted at our Election Officer Training website.
- Otherwise, offer the voter a provisional ballot.

The Electoral Board will review the situation and determine if the ballot should be counted.
