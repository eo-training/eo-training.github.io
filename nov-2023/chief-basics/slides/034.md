For voters who have moved, you will frequently consult the Moving Conditions chart on page 10 of the _What-Ifs_. These can often be the most confusing thing for a new Chief or Assistant Chief, but we're going to walk you through it!

As shown in the previous slide, you can use the My Neighborhood app to see which precincts correspond to the voter's old and new addresses. The Precinct Locator (also titled "Directory of Districts, Precincts & Polling Places") icon links to the list in numerical order by precinct number, which gives congressional district number, polling place building name and address, among other information. Help your voter find their correct precinct.
