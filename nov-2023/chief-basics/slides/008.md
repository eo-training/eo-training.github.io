There are 2 things to do the day before the election:

- **Pick up election supplies on the Monday before election day**. Chiefs will pick up the Poll Pads and black kit with election materials on the Monday before election day. You will need to take these items directly to your polling place for setup.

- **Go to polling place, set up voting room.** The day before the election, the Chief and Assistant Chief should go to the polling place and do initial setup of the voting room. Invite any available officers to join you! You should set up the overall room, including the tables, chairs, handouts, and indoor signs (do not post the outside signs as they could be moved or removed before election morning). You are allowed to open the equipment cart (use the opening and closing guides for the equipment cart) and inspect or use the contents inside as long as there is at least one other officer present, and you seal it again before you leave. The only exception is for ballots, and voting equipment (i.e. the DS200s and ExpressVote machines), and envelopes containing machine keys. - do NOT open these before election day! Leave the DS200s in the locked cart overnight.
