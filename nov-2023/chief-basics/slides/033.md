What if someone shows up to vote, but they are not registered in your precinct?

- Confirm that the voter lives in your precinct. The easiest way to do this is by using the My Neighborhood app on the Admin Tablet. This will tell you what precinct any address in the County corresponds to. You can use it to determine if a voter lives in your precinct, and to determine what precinct a voter moved from.

- Simply type the address into the search bar to see what precinct it belongs to. Be sure to get the city right, as there are several streets with the same name in the County.

- We typed in 4725 West Ox Rd, Fairfax, VA into the search bar and found that this address is within the boundaries of precinct 848 FAIR OAKS.
