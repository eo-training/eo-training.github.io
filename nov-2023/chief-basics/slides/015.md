As a regular election officer in the past, you have helped process all **routine** voters. These are voters who can be checked-in on the Poll Pad without issue.

As a Chief or Assistant Chief, you will help process all **non-routine** voters. If an election officer cannot check-in a voter, they will direct them to the Chief's Table for you to help them. If the non-routine voter wants to do a same day registration, tell your officers to direct the voter to the Chief first, who will do the analysis to determine if the voter is eligible to do SDR in your precinct. The SDR Specialist oversees the completion of the registration application and provisional process and may have a separate table set up near the Chief's Table.
