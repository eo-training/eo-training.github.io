Keep provisional envelopes readily available, as you will need to use them for any voters needing to do a same day registration (sometimes shortened to SDR). Provide the voter with a provisional envelope and direct voter to fill out Virgina Voter Registration Application on SDR side of envelope.

If a voter lives in your precinct and they are not registered, or their registration is not up to date, they may do a same day registration. This process consists of two parts:

- Issuing a voter registration application
- Issuing a provisional ballot

The provisional process for an SDR is the same as for a provisional ballot issued for another reason, which we will go over in detail later in this training. Office of Elections staff will process these voter registration applications, determine if a voter is eligible to register, and make a recommendation to the Electoral Board, who adjudicate all provisional ballots. It's important that you ensure the voter registration application and provisional envelope are filled out completely and signed!

If the voter does not currently reside in your precinct, consult the What-Ifs or call the office to determine the next steps.

Remember that on election day, you will have step-by-step instructions in your Chiefs Notebook, and you can always call us with any questions.
