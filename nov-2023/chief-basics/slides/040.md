Same Day Registration allows voters who either are not registered or who did not update their registration to do a same day registration. Part of the SDR process involves using the Moving Conditions. Same day registration is a  **provisional process**. The SDR voter must vote a provisional ballot which is not cast on the DS200 scanner. The voter will be provided an SDR provisional envelope, on which is a  **Virginia Voter Registration Application** , which the voter fills out. If their registration is accepted and successfully processed, only then is their provisional ballot considered by the Electoral Board.

- WHO: Voter not registered or registration not up to date.

- WHERE: Voter must be present at the precinct for address where the voter currently resides.

- HOW: Voter completes Voter Registration Application on the front side of the provisional envelope, then casts a provisional ballot. Follow procedure outlined in Chiefs Notebook.

- Every precinct will have an SDR Specialist to help with this process. All Chiefs and SDR Specialists are required to complete the SDR Basics online training class with more info.
