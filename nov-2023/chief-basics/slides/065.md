A very important reminder about signatures:

We really do not want you, or your officers, to have to come into our office after a day of hard work. Before leaving the polling place on election day, review the Signature Checklist in the Chiefs Notebook one last time to make sure everything is signed properly.

Note that there are three categories of documents requiring signatures: Documents that must be signed by ALL officers. 2) Documents that must be signed by all officers present for closing. #) Items that must be signed by some officers at closing.

Be a hero, have zero missing signatures!
