The Statement of Results (SOR) is the most important document you will complete on election night because it is the record of votes in your precinct.

You will use the SOR to account for voters checked in and all ballots used and unused. You will also attach printed tapes from the DS200s with the voting results.

There will be an identical SOR copy, SOR â€“ B, that you will also complete (the official SOR goes to the courthouse while the copy stays in our office).
