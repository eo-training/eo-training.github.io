- All voters who are in line or inside the polling place building at 7:00 PM can vote! If they are inside the building and walking to the voting room, they are allowed to vote! Similarly, any voters who are in the curbside parking spots by 7:00 PM are allowed to vote.
- All absentee voters who are in line or within the polling place at 7:00 PM may deposit their absentee ballots in the absentee ballot drop box.
- Be sure to delegate! Any officer can do any task.
- Dismiss election officers only after ALL work is complete and Chief's car is packed.
- Lastly, the Chief must drive some materials back to the designated return site. Your election officers should help pack your car! Some materials are heavy.

With these tips, you should be well-prepared for your first time as a Chief or Assistant Chief.
