This class will assume you are familiar with the current list of acceptable IDs, Poll Pads and how to check in voters, DS200s and how to cast ballots, and officer duties and expected behavior.

If you need a refresher on any of these topics, feel free to pause this training and view part or all of the online Election Officer Basics class.
