Neither you nor your officers need to memorize how to perform election tasks. There are procedural guides to walk you through most election day tasks such as opening and closing the equipment, collector officer duties, and for how to check in voters. Make sure you distribute the guides at the appropriate times to the officers handling those tasks. Direct your officers to follow the instructions in the exact order given and check off each task as they go. There are copies of the guides in the Chief's Notebook for your use.
