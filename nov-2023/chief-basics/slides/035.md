There are two questions you must ask: 1) When did the voter move? 2) How far did the voter move?

First, you should ask the voter about exactly when they moved. Once you know the date they moved (or at least the month and year), you will look for the correct row that matches. For example, a voter who has moved in 2023 would be in the row that is for "on or after Nov 9, 2022."

Next, you need to determine how far the voter has moved. If they moved within the same precinct, we look at the leftmost column and see they can always vote routinely, no matter when they moved. Similarly, if they have moved out-of-state, we look at the rightmost column and see they cannot vote normally, unless it is within 30 days of a presidential election. If they cannot vote normally, you should always offer a provisional ballot.

The hard part is when they have moved within Fairfax County. You will need to determine the congressional district of both their old and new precincts. Use both the My Neighborhood app and the Precinct Locator tool to make this determination. Depending on if they moved within the same congressional district or into a different congressional district, you would look in the corresponding columns and find out if they can vote normally.

Generally speaking, a voter who has moved will have to go to their registered (or "old") precinct.
