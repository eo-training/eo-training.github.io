What if someone shows up to vote, but they are not registered in your precinct?

- Inform them that Virginia law states that they must vote in their registered precinct for their vote to count.

- If the voter has moved and is present in the correct precinct for their new address, the Chief of that precinct can offer the Same Day Registration process!

- If the voter does not live in the precinct, help them go to the correct precinct. Again, Virginia law states that you must vote in your registered precinct on election day for your vote to count. You can use the My Neighborhood app and the Precinct Locator to find the correct precinct for the current address and the precinct number, polling place building, and address for the correct precinct.
