Here is a sample of a Virginia Voter Registration Application. This form is used for voters who simply need to update their name or address, but are not eligible to do SDR in your precinct.

Whenever you have a non-SDR voter who has moved without updating their voter registration, you should always offer them a Voter Registration Application. If they complete it and turn it in to you, return it in **Envelope # 8** and our office will process it shortly after the election.
