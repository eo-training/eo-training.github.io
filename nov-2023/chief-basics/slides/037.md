Let's take a look at another example situation. What if a voter moved in May 2021 to another precinct in Fairfax County? For the purposes of this example, let's assume they moved within the same congressional district.

- First, we look for the row that matches the moving date. May 2021 is between November 4, 2020 and November 8, 2022, so we are looking in the middle row.
- Next, we look for the column that matches how far the voter moved. In this case, they moved within Fairfax County and within **the same congressional district,** which is the second column.
- Therefore, we can see that they can vote in their "old" precinct if otherwise eligible after signing an Affirmation of Eligibility.

As you can see on the chart, if a voter has moved within Fairfax County, the date when they moved is very important. Whether or not they are permitted to vote routinely, you should offer them a Voter Registration application so they may update their registered address.
