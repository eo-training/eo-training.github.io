Now it's election morning. What do you need to do?

- **Swear in officers at 5:00 AM**. Don't wait for late officers; you can swear them in when they arrive. The important part is to swear in the officers who are present, so you can get started. If you have High School Pages in a November election, you should swear them in as well. All officers must sign Oath form (Chief signs in two places).

- **Delegate tasks and work in parallel.** Prepare a plan in advance for officer opening assignments. Decide with your Assistant Chief how you will divide oversight duties. Split up assigned tasks among your officers, distribute the opening procedure guides, and have the officers get started. Put your best officers on the most important tasks, including setting up the Poll Pads, setting up the DS200 scanners, and opening the ballots. Some Chiefs ask their officers in advance what their strengths are, and what they may want more practice with before election day. This can help you plan for the day!

- **Open polls promptly at 6:00 AM.** You must open the polls on time, even if you haven't finished lower-priority tasks like putting up signs.
