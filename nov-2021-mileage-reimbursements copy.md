In each election, some officers are eligible for mileage reimbursement:

- **Chiefs** are eligible for mileage reimbursement for picking up election materials before election day and returning election materials on election night.
- **Collector Officers** are eligible for mileage reimbursement for returning election materials on election night. <u>Note that only the driver is eligible for mileage reimbursement.</u>

All election officers are hired as stipend-only county employees and are therefore subject to all Fairfax County Government employee mileage reimbursement policies and procedures.

For 2021, the county mileage reimbursement rate is <span>$</span>0.56 per mile.

## Mileage reimbursement calculations

After consultation with the Department of Finance, the Office of Elections had to update how we calculate mileage reimbursements to be fully compliant with all county policies and procedures. If we did not make these changes, we could not issue mileage reimbursements for this election.

Specifically, for each day of travel, Fairfax County Government requires employees (including all election officers) to deduct the mileage you would travel to the location where you spend more than 50% of your time. For all election officers, this is your assigned polling place.

**If you picked up election materials before election day, we calculated your mileage reimbursement as:**
- <span style="color:darkGreen;">LEG 1: Home to pickup location (i.e. Fairfax County Government Center or Sherwood Regional Library)</span>
- <span style="color:darkGreen;">LEG 2: Pickup location to home</span>
- <span style="color:darkRed;">MINUS home to polling place to home</span>

**If you returned election materials on election night, we calculated your mileage reimbursement as:**
- <span style="color:darkGreen;">LEG 1: Home to polling place</span>
- <span style="color:darkGreen;">LEG 2: Polling place to return location (i.e. Fairfax County Government Center, Mount Vernon Government Center, or North County Government Center)</span>
- <span style="color:darkGreen;">LEG 3: Return location to home</span>
- <span style="color:darkRed;">MINUS home to polling place to home</span>

## Examples

Here is an example for a **Chief** who both picked up election materials and returned election materials:
- PICKUP: 8 miles for picking up election materials (Home to pickup location to home = 14 miles, Home to polling place to home = 6 miles, Net travel = 8 miles)
- RETURN: 12 miles for returning election materials (Home to polling place to return location to home = 18 miles, Home to polling place to home = 6 miles, Net travel = 12 miles)
- TOTAL: 20 miles eligible for reimbursement at <span>$</span>0.56/mile = <span>$</span>11.20 total reimbursement

Here is an example for a **Collector Officer** who only returned election materials:
- PICKUP: n/a
- RETURN: 12 miles for returning election materials (Home to polling place to return location to home = 18 miles, Home to polling place to home = 6 miles, Net travel = 12 miles)
- TOTAL: 12 miles eligible for reimbursement at <span>$</span>0.56/mile = <span>$</span>6.72 total reimbursement
