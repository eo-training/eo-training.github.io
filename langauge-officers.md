Language officers are election officers who in addition to performing all regular officer duties, may also assist voters in a language other than English. All language officers are assessed for language proficiency before being assigned. We assign language officers to precincts based on Census data and voter feedback. We are required to assign language officers proficient in Spanish, Vietnamese, and Korean to precincts with language needs.

In June 2022, we will implement a language officer referral bonus program; more information coming soon!
