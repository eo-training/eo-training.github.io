## Quiz Instructions

If you are assigned as a Chief, Assistant Chief, Reserve Chief, or Reserve Assistant Chief, you must take a 1-question quiz in the Election Officer Portal after watching the briefing to receive credit. **The quiz must be completed by Thursday, October 28, at 11:59 PM to meet statutory requirements.**

The quiz is available in the Election Officer Portal. Go to the Training tab, then scroll down to the very bottom right corner of the page, and look for a "Take quiz" link. If you have multiple quiz links, make sure you are taking the one corresponding to the "Chiefs Briefing" and not another class in which you may be enrolled.

If you are unable to take the 1-question quiz, contact us at ElectionOfficerTraining@fairfaxcounty.gov or 703-324-4735 (weekdays 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM) and we can mark it completed for you.
