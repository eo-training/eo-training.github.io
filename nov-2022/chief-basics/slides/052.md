**Section 8:** The last section of the SOR is the easiest but can be the easiest to forget to do! Make sure all officers present during closing procedures sign both copies of the SOR.

- Do **NOT** have your officers pre-sign during the day. We have occasionally received SORs back that have all their officer signatures - but no information completed above! Don't be that precinct.
- If you have officers who were sworn in but not present for closing procedures, note that in their designated signature spot on the SOR. For example, write in "Collector Officer" to explain why those officers did not sign the SOR. This helps us quickly figure out the difference between an officer who intentionally did not sign the SOR and an officer who simply forgot to sign the SOR!
