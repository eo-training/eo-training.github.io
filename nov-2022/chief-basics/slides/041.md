This is a sample of the Provisional Ballot Log.

For each provisional voter, you will record some basic information about them here, including their name, address, year of birth, and phone number. The voter writes this information on the individual provisional envelopes, so you can simply copy it over.

You must also select a numerical reason code for each provisional voter - these are the same as the codes listed on the provisional envelopes.

Your paper Provisional Ballot Log will serve as a backup to the digital log you must also complete. We use a digital log so we can meet legally mandated deadlines and accurately prepare for the Electoral Board's Provisional Meeting. It also ensures that we have the voter's information spelled correctly and don't make any mistakes reading handwriting! So, take your time filling it out and make sure all information is correct.
