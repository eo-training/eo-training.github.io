What should you do if a voter is not listed in the pollbook?

- First, try doing an advanced search on the Poll Pad to try to find the voter by their date of birth, address, or other identifying information.
- If you still can't find the voter, call the Office of Elections. It may be an error and the office may give you instructions on how to add the voter to your pollbook.
- Otherwise, offer the voter a provisional ballot.

The Electoral Board will review the situation and determine if the ballot should be counted.
