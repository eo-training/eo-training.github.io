On election day, when voters arrive at their polling locations, they provide their name and address, and present identification, all before casting a ballot. Of course, the process is very different for an authorized absentee voter who is submitting a ballot by mail or in a drop box.

An authorized absentee voter who is taking advantage of the Vote By Mail option must return a voter submission that typically contains two components:

- A return mailer. The return mailer includes the Office of Elections address on the front. The voter information label and _Statement of Absentee Voter_ is on the reverse side.
- A ballot inside the return mailer.

Mailers may look different based on the status and location of the voter.

For mailer check-in staff, the return mailer is critical. The mailer represents the absentee voter. On the mailer, the voter is stating his/her name and address. In lieu of presenting identification, the voter provides a signature attesting that the information is correct.

Note that in some cases, a voter must provide additional documentation. We will discuss these specific instances later.
