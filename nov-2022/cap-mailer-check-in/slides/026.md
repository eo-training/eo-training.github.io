Voters living overseas may request a ballot file be emailed to them. The voters print their ballots and the return envelope templates and send back the hard copies by regular mail.

Voters may choose to tape the return envelope template containing the address of the Office of Elections to their own envelopes or may use their own envelope addressed by hand.
