The terminology used to describe groupings of mailers as they move through the absentee ballot process can be confusing.

For clarification:

One tray contains one bundle of mailers.

One bundle (tray) contains mailers pre-banded into sets. A full bundle (tray) will contain approximately 6 sets of mailers.

One set contains fifty mailers pre-banded together. A full bundle (tray) containing 6 sets of mailers will contain approximately 300 mailers.

One group = ten mailers. During the check-in process, mailers are scanned in groups of 10.
