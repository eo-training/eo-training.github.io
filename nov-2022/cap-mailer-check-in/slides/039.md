Step 3. Immediately transfer the bundle number label to the front of a green tray. This step is very important. The checked-in mailers from the original tray must all stay together in one green tray with the same bundle number. Also write the bundle number on the Mailer Count Worksheet.

Step 4. Remove a set of banded mailers from the red tray. Quickly "eyeball" each mailer in the set and remove any email ballots (because these do not have scannable bar codes) and any Unused mailers. Give these to the Team Leader. After removing any mis-sorted mailers, count the remaining mailers in the set. Place this number in the Mailers at Start column on the Mailer Count Worksheet.
