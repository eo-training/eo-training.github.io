Virginia state law offers an absentee voter the opportunity to correct a material omission on the voter statement. If a voter has provided incorrect or incomplete information on the voter statement that would cause the ballot to be disallowed, the Office of Elections will notify the voter of the material omission and further stipulate how to correct the issue so the ballot may be counted. This is called the "curing" process.

Some absentee voters may opt to come, in person, to the Office of Elections to "cure" their submission.

Others may choose to provide (by mail or email), a signed affidavit containing the corrected information. When this affidavit arrives at the Office of Elections it will be placed with the voter's original mailer. In this case, you may review the information in the affidavit for material omissions and use the affidavit information to check in the voter on VERIS.

Note that it may be necessary to review the affidavit in conjunction with the original voter statement. For example, if the voter forgot the city or zip code on the original voter statement and then submitted an affidavit with only the corrected city or zip code, you may look at both components to determine completeness.
