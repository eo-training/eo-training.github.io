Important Reminders:

- Mailer Check-In is a "one-person team" operation. Please ensure that you carefully follow all mailer check-in procedures.

2. Mailer check-in operations have eliminated one step but added another. You are no longer required to update a voter's ballot status in VERIS to "Marked" before updating the status to "Pre-Processed". Instead, you now directly change the voter's ballot status to "Pre-Processed". But just when you thought we were saving you some process time, a second step was added into the operation: the inclusion of a Bundle Number in each voter's record. We will address the how and why of this additional step later in the training.

3. Mailers are not opened and ballots are not removed from the mailers by the Check-In Team.

- An additional review of checked-in mailers is now a standard practice, completed at the end of each Mailer Check-In day. This step functions as a "double check" to ensure accurate recording in VERIS.

These changes have been instituted so that the entire CAP operation can function more efficiently. However, there is NO change to what is expected of mailer check-in staff: a compliance with operational procedures, an attention to detail, and a focus on accuracy.
