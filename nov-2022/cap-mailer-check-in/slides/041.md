Now you have a set of approximately 50 mailers in front of you. You have verified that the information label matches the voter statement **and** you have determined that the voter statement is complete (with no material omissions) on each of the mailers.

Divide this set of 50 mailers into 5 groups of 10 mailers. You will work with one group at a time. Note: If you have placed any mailers in the "Needs Cure" table box, the last group may contain less than 10 mailers.

Now let the scanning begin!

Step 6. Select the first group of 10 mailers. Select the first mailer in that group and scan the barcode on the voter information label.

Some important scanning particulars:

- Position the head of the scanner level and close to the table.
- Be sure to only take hold of one mailer at a time and carefully slide the mailer under the scanner beam. Listen for a "success" beep.
- Then, cautiously remove the mailer out from under the scanner beam. Overly hurried, random movements often cause a mailer to be re-scanned by mistake. You do not want to hear a second beep! Take your time...scan mailers carefully and deliberately.
