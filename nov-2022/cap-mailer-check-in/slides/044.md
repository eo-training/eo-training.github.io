Step 13. Verify that each voter's status indicates "Pre-Processed". Verify that the correct bundle number appears in the _Status Reason_ field for each voter.

Step 14. **CLICK SAVE** at the bottom left-hand corner of the page. This is a critical step. Then, place the 10 scanned mailers in the "Saved in VERIS" table box.

Step 15. Continue process until all mailers in set have been scanned. Remember to scan one group of 10 mailers at a time and be sure to click "Save" at the end of each group.

As each group of 10 mailers is successfully checked-in and saved in VERIS, place the group in the "Saved in VERIS" table box. When you complete the entire set, you will have mailers from approximately 50 absentee voters in the table box. The status of every one of these voters is now "Pre-Processed".
