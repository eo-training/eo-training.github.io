Once you select the correct voter from the search list, the Voter Overview page appears.

Verify that you have located the correct voter by comparing the name on the voter statement with the information on the VERIS screen. Do they match?

Do you have the correct election? The screen should display "2022 November General Election". If the current election does not show, click on the drop-down arrow in the "Election" field and select the correct election.

Then ask yourself, was the voter issued an absentee ballot? If yes, _Status_ will indicate "Issued". If the _Status_ does not say "Issued", notify the team leader.

When you have confirmed that the information is correct, click on the pencil icon at the lower right of the screen, next to the "Issued" status. This will allow you to edit the voter's record to show that the voter's ballot was received.
