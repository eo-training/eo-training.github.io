If a voter does not present an acceptable form of ID, call the Chief! The Chief will offer the voter an ID Confirmation Statement. As you can see, it's a quick form to fill out!

By completing this short form, a voter would be allowed to vote normally. That means you would issue them a regular ballot, they would mark it at the polling place, and they would cast it in a DS200 scanner.
