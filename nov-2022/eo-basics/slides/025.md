Some officers may be assigned to serve as Collector Officers. During the day, these officers will perform all regular officer duties. During closing, they help transport sensitive election materials, such as the absentee ballot envelopes deposited in the drop box and the DS200 flash drives, to the Fairfax County Government Center.

These officers should not be confused with the officer that is assigned to monitor the drop box. Any officer can monitor the drop box. Communicate with your Chief and the rest of the team to make sure you are being rotated among duties!

If assigned to monitor the drop box, you will have a set of reminders for voters attached to the drop box that you may use to help assist voters. Remember that voters are not required to provide any identification when depositing ballots and may use any drop box in the County, even if it is not at their assigned precinct.
