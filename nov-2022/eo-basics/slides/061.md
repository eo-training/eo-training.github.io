To close the Poll Pads, follow the instructions from the closing guide. Record any needed information from the Poll Pads and then put them away. You will need to disassemble the Poll Pads and return the Poll Pad as well as the ID holder, charger, and base to the case. The peripherals are interchangeable, but be sure to return the Poll Pad device to the case it was packed in. Simply match up the identification number on the back of the Poll Pad to the number on the tag of the case.
