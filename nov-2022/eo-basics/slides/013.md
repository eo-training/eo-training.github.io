At 5:00 AM, the Chief will swear in all officers. Then, the Chief will divide you into teams to complete the following tasks before 6:00 AM, when polls open:

- Open and set up the Poll Pads, the electronic poll books used to check-in voters
- Open and set up the ExpressVote, the ballot marking device
- Open and set up the DS200 scanners, which count and scan votes
- Post all signs, inside and outside, and mark the 40-foot Prohibited Area.

Don't worry, you don't have to memorize anything! The Chief will have guides with instructions for setting up and closing the Poll Pads, ExpressVote, and DS200 scanners.
