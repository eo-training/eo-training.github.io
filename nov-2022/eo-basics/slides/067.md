The morning after the election, we will send out a post-election survey by email. It only takes 5 minutes to complete and really helps us identify any issues to address and make improvements for future elections. Make sure to complete it as soon as possible, while your memories of election day are fresh.

Due to Fairfax County Government's rolling pay schedule, you will receive payment 4 to 6 weeks after election day. All election officers are required to enroll in direct deposit, so the payment will automatically show up in your selected bank account. We will email you when the payments have been deposited.

Finally, on behalf of the Fairfax County Office of Elections, we want to thank you for taking this training and being willing to serve as an election officer. We could not conduct successful elections without amazing people like you - so thank you!
