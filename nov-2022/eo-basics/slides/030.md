Here are some samples of valid IDs. They include:

- Virginia driver's license
- Virginia identification card (sometimes referred to as a "walker's license")
- Virginia voter ID (note that it has an _issue date_, not an expiration date)
- US passport or US passport card
- US federal or military ID
- Work ID with photo
- College/University ID (which must have a photo only if the college does not have a campus in Virginia)
- Government ID from a government located in Virginia

Note that many of these IDs do not have an address or expiration date, but they are still valid for voting.
