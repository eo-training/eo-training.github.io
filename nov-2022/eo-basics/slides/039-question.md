question1: "Let's look at two Virginia driver's licenses. One expired in 2016 and one expires in 2025. Which of these is valid for voting?"
solution1: C
solution1text: "Answer: It's a trick question: both of these can be used to vote! Remember, you should completely disregard the expiration date on driver's licenses. This is the only form of ID that can be used more than 12 months past the expiration date (as specifically written in the Code of Virginia)."
option1A: "License that expires in 2025"
option1B: "License that expires in 2016"
option1C: "Both"
option1D: "Neither"
