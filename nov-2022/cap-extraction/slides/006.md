Pre-processing, phase 1, step 2: extraction. Now that the day's batches of return mailers have been opened, it's time to remove, or extract, the enclosed folded ballot from its mailer.

Extraction is done by teams of 2-4 people with one person designated as the table team leader. Team member duties include removing folded ballots from their mailers, identification and proper handling of damaged ballots, accurate accounting of ballots and return mailers, and preparing ballots for scan team processing. A team member is also responsible for notifying their team leader when they come across what is known as a faulty return mailer. A faulty return mailer is one in which the contents are not as they should be. Examples include no ballot or an empty mailer, a mailer with two or more ballots in it, or a mailer that contains only election information materials but no ballot. When this happens, the team member notifies their table team leader. The team leader notifies the Extraction Operation Supervisor who removes the faulty return mailer from the batch, directs the team leader to adjust their batch count, and forwards the faulty mailer to the Curing team.
