Now that you've had an overview of the extraction process, let's go step by step. When extraction teams are ready, the Extraction Operation Supervisor places one batch of opened return mailers on each table. A batch averages 700-900 mailers contained in approximately 1-2 yellow trays.

From the tray, each team member takes a handful of return mailers and places the stack in front of them. Taking one mailer at a time, the folded ballot is removed from its return mailer. The still folded ballot is then placed into the box marked "ballots" and the empty return mailer placed in the box marked "mailer". These 2 boxes are located on your tabletop. Periodically, you'll come across a ballot that is badly stained, torn or crumpled, missing timing marks, and so on. These ballots are considered damaged and cannot be automatically counted or scanned by the DS850. They are known as non-scannable and are placed in a black tray on top of the worktable. These non-scannable ballots will be counted by hand after the polls close on election day. This extraction process continues until the team's batch tray is empty. Please remember, all extraction work is conducted on the tabletop. Return mailers and ballots must be always visible.
