You are ready to begin the actual operation...finally!

Step 1. Ensure that you have accessed the correct VERIS screen; you will see the _Received Date_ and the _Received By Method_ fields on the screen.

Step 2. The team leader provides a red or gray tray containing unopened digital domestic and/or UOCAVA return mailers, all with scannable barcodes. All the mailers in the tray have been received on the same date and by the same method. Look for the bundle number on the front of the tray. Change the _Received Date_ and _Received by Method_ on the VERIS screen, if necessary, to correlate with the bundle number and color of tray.
