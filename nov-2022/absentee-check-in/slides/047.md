Step 17. Almost done! Your last task is to complete the Mailer Count worksheet to account for both the checked-in mailers and "Needs Cure" mailers.

- Count the number of domestic checked-in mailers. Record this number in the _Checked-in Domestic Mailers_ column for Set 1. If you have checked-in UOCAVA voters, be sure to record this number in the appropriate column.

- When you were evaluating the voter statement for material omissions, did you place any mailers in the "Needs Cure" table box? Record this number in the _Needs Cure Mailers_ column for Set 1.

The number of checked-in mailers + the number of needs cure mailers = the number of mailers at start. (We hope!) These numbers must reconcile.

When reconciliation is complete, attach a "Needs Cure" wrap to the mailers that will be sent to curing. Ensure that each mailer has been labeled with a "reason" for curing. On the wrap, write the Bundle #, Set # and total number of mailers included within the wrap. Leave these mailers in the "Needs Cure" table box.
