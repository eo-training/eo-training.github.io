The voter information label and _Statement of Absentee Voter_ is printed on the reverse side of the return mailer.

The information on the reverse side of the return mailer is very important:

- Note the voter information label circled in red. This label contains identifying information about the authorized absentee voter, including the voter's name, address, voter ID #, and unique scannable barcode. The label also specifies the current election as well as the voter's congressional district (CD) and precinct. The label will include the letters "NA" if a Request for Assistance form must be submitted by the voter. The label will indicate "ID Required" if an acceptable form of ID must be submitted (usually by a first-time voter who has registered by mail), per Help America Vote Act (HAVA) guidelines.

- This same voter must complete the _Statement of Absentee Voter_ located beneath the label.

- Check-in staff will review the information both on the voter information label and the _Statement of Absentee Voter_ to determine if the correct authorized absentee voter has mailed in the ballot and if any material omissions are present.
