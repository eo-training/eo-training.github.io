VERIS can be used to track the status of a voter's ballot as it winds its way through the absentee ballot process. After a voter's absentee voting application has been processed, VERIS indicates that a ballot has been "Issued". The voter marks the ballot and returns it to the Office of Elections. When the ballot is received at the Office of Elections, the Mailer Check-In team determines if the correct authorized absentee voter completed the voter statement AND if any material omissions are present. Once the mailer is "qualified" by the Check-In staff, the ballot status is updated to "Pre-Processed" in VERIS.

There are two ways to update a ballot status in VERIS depending on whether there is a scannable barcode on the voter's information label.

We are going to begin our discussion with the **batch scanning** method. Batch scanning is used when your set of mailers all have scannable bar codes, typically domestic digital/UOCAVA submissions. This is the method you will use most often. If done properly, batch scanning is very efficient.

To begin batch scanning, log into VERIS and land on the VERIS home page. Place the cursor over "Absentee" on the navigation bar. Then select "AB Batch Receipt – without IDs" from the drop-down menu.
