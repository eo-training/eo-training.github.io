One of CAPs main objectives is to fairly evaluate the mail-in and drop box submissions from Fairfax County voters as well as to scrupulously account for their ballots and their votes. Mailer Check-In is an integral element of this operation.

In accordance with state law, authorized absentee voter submissions may be processed by CAP staff. This procedure entails:

- evaluating the voter submissions returned by mail or drop box
- updating a voter's status in VERIS (the state-wide data base)

Check-in data is ultimately included in the Statement of Results (SOR) on election day.
