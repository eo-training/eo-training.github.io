The left side of this slide shows the items that need to be edited and verified. We must ensure VERIS reflects the correct information for the voter.

- Confirm the _Ballot Received Date_ is the same as the date indicated on the tray label. If not, adjust the date by clicking on the calendar icon.

- The _Received by Method_ field defaults to "Mail" which means the return mailer was delivered by the post office or a commercial mail delivery service (UPS, FEDEX, DHL). If the return mailer was received from a voter drop off location, _Received by Method_ should be changed to "Drop Off".

- Change the _Status_ from "Issued" to "Pre-Processed".

- Add the bundle number into the _Ballot Status Comment_ field.

- Click save. VERIS will then return you to the voter's overview page which will reflect the changed ballot status.
