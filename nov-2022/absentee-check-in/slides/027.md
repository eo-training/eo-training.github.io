An email voter must complete the same Statement of Absentee Voter as other UOCAVA voters and is subject to the same set of material omissions. No address is required. No date is required. The voter does not even have to provide a printed name.

However, the signatures of the voter and a witness are required. If either of the two signatures is missing, the mailer cannot be checked in. Place the mailer in the "Needs Cure" table box.

The voter statement is typically taped to the back of the return mailer; the voter's name is readily accessible and can be used to find and update the voter's record in VERIS. However, if a voter encloses the voter statement inside the return mailer, place the mailer in the Needs Cure table box. As is standard practice, you may not open the mailer to examine the voter statement.

And one more thing: be prepared for many different sizes of return mailers with lots of tape!
