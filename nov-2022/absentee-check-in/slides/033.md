In order to access the VERIS database, you must first log into Fairfax County using your county logon credentials. Once you are logged into Fairfax County, click the VERIS icon on the desktop and then sign into VERIS, using your VERIS logon credentials.

Please note: It is important to remember both your Fairfax County username/password as well as your VERIS username/password. Do not confuse these!

For security, do not leave your computer unattended. If you need to step away from the computer, be sure to log out. Likewise, at the end of your shift, log out of VERIS and sign out of the Fairfax County network.
