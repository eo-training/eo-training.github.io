The reverse side of a UOCAVA mailer includes the voter information label and the voter statement, just as on the domestic mailer; however, the _Statement of UOCAVA Absentee Voter_ is very different.

No address is required. No date is required. In fact, the voter does not even have to provide a printed name.

What is required? Only the voter's signature and the signature of a witness. If either of these two signatures is missing, the mailer cannot be checked in. Place the mailer in the "Needs Cure" table box.
