The Statement of Results (SOR) is the most important document you will complete on election night because it is the record of votes in your precinct.

There will also be an identical SOR Copy that you will also complete (the official SOR goes to the courthouse while the copy stays in our office).

The SOR helps answer 3 basic questions:

- How many voters were checked in?
- How many ballots were counted?
- How many votes did each candidate receive?
