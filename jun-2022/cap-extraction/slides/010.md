The QA team is now in charge! To start, the team takes the table's yellow trays of bundled return mailers and the batch box to their work area. Step one, they'll put the bundled return mailers in to a #5 box, take a batch number label from one of the yellows tray and put it on the side of the #5 box. Step one done!

Step two is verification of the batch box contents. Ballots stacked face down, check. Paper tabs removed, check. Ballot batch tracking log completed, check. Damaged/non-scannable ballots on top of the log, check. Step two done!

Step three consists of QA specific actions: two blue batch box labels pre-printed with the corresponding batch number put inside; second batch number taken from the other yellow tray and placed on the outside of the box; box sealed with black security tape; each QA team member signs across the security tape. Step three done!

Once all QA actions have been completed, the team enters the required information on the "opening and extraction operation master log".
