To begin, let's discuss VERIS.

The Virginia Election and Registration Information System (VERIS) is a database that contains highly sensitive information about all registered voters throughout the state of Virginia. As such, it is crucial that this information be protected and not shared with others who do not have a need to know. VERIS voter data is only to be used in CAP in the execution of your role as a member of the mailer check-in staff.

FYI: When accessing and using the VERIS system you will be asked to consent to system monitoring for law enforcement and other purposes. Unauthorized use of this computer system may subject you to State or Federal criminal prosecution and penalties.
