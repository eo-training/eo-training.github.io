Once you are sure that the authorized absentee voter has completed the voter statement (i.e., the voter information label and the Statement of Absentee Voter information agree), the voter statement must be reviewed for material omissions.

- The voter statement must be filled out correctly and completely. It must contain:

- Voter's name

- Voter's address

- Voter's signature

- Witness signature

2. A date is NOT required.

If any required information is missing, place the mailer in the "Needs Cure" table box.
