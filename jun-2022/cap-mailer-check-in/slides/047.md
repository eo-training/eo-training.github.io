Periodically, you will not be able to use the "Batch" method to scan mailers and check voters into VERIS; for example, when receiving a mailer from a voter who has requested an email ballot.

As you have already learned, a voter living overseas or military personnel living anywhere may request to receive their ballot by email. The voter uses templates in a PDF attachment to create their ballot and their return mailer. Once printed, the voted ballot must be inserted into a return mailer and mailed back to the Office of Elections.

This mailer does not have a preprinted voter information label with a barcode. You will need to check this voter into VERIS manually.

The majority of these mailers will arrive at your workstation in a blue tray. The bundle number at the front of the tray will include the letter "E" to designate email.
