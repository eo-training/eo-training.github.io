The Office of Elections staff reviews and sorts mailers as they arrive at the Government Center. They attach an appropriate sticker and set aside any unused voter packets, Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots (FWABs), and voided mailers. Typically, these will not be seen by the mailer check-in staff.

However, if one slips into one of your trays of mailers, give it to the team leader. Do not attempt to find this voter in VERIS or to check-in the ballot.
