A critical mailer check-in task is to verify that the authorized absentee voter has completed the Statement of Absentee Voter. Therefore, it is very important that the voter's name and address on the voter information label match the information provided by the voter on the mailer.

Typically, the Statement of Absentee Voter and the voter information label will contain the same voter information...but not always.

If you encounter a mismatch between the voter information label and the voter's statement, do not check-in this mailer. Place the mailer in the "Needs Cure" table box.
