Because you have taken this training and will also take on oath on Election Day, you are considered part of the official election team.  As such, you will follow the same code of conduct as the election officers.  You will treat voters with respect including seniors and those with disabilities. This is not a partisan activity so everything you do must be impartial and nonpolitical. You will not engage in discussions about candidates or other political issues.

Although the act of voting is public, how an individual votes must be private.  You, along with the rest of your election team, will work to ensure voter privacy thus safeguarding the security and integrity of the election.
