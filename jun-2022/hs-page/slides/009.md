Some of you will choose the 12:30 p.m. – 8:30 p.m. (or afternoon) shift.  Your responsibilities will include helping the election team close the polls after voting ends.  Even though it will be light outside when you head to your polling place, you should still take the time to review the directions, and again, call your Chief Election Officer if for any reason you are running late.
