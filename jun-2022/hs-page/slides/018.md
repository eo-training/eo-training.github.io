These are some of the signs that will be posted inside the polling place.  They include directional arrows, voting instructions, sample ballots, and a poster that will explain the referendum on the ballot.  This year there will be one County bond question on the ballot, and it will be for school improvements. 

A bond is like asking the voters if they want to take out a loan to finance projects like building schools, or renovating libraries, or maybe improving park facilities.
