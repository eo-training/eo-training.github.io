Be sensitive about personal contact. Grabbing someone, even if you intend to give assistance, could knock the person off balance.  Don’t pat anyone on the head, shoulders, or back. It can be demeaning and throw the person off balance. Lightly tap the person’s shoulder if you need to get their attention.
