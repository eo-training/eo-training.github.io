One piece of information that is on some IDs but not others is the expiration date. How do you handle this?

For most IDs, if it does not have an expiration date, that's OK. As long as it is a valid form of ID for voting, you can automatically accept it. If the ID does have an expiration date listed, then it can be used for up to 12 months past the expiration date. After that, it is no longer valid for voting.

There is one major exception to this rule. The Code of Virginia now specifically says that a driver's license may be used for voting, regardless of when it expired.

In terms of the documents that can be accepted for voting purposes, note that a utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document must not be more than 12 months old. Don't forget to look for a date on these documents!
