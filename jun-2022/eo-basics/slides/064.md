The most important document during closing procedures is the Statement of Results (SOR). This is the record of all votes in your precinct. Usually the Chief and Assistant Chief will fill this out, possibly with help from other officers.

Do not leave the polling place without signing the SOR and the SOR copy! Sign on the same numbered row as you did on the Oath and Compensation sheet in the morning. This will help everyone in the precinct check that all documents are signed and is a big help to us here in the office.
