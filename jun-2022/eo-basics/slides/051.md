When a voter inserts a **regularly marked ballot** , the DS200 will accept and scan it. Voters should be encouraged to wait at the machine until the "Thank You" screen is displayed.

The voter will also see this screen if they have an **under-voted ballot**. This means the voter voted for fewer candidates or contests than they were allowed. For example, in a presidential election, some voters will only vote for president and no other contests on the ballot. Again, in this case, the DS200 will accept the ballot without issue and the "Thank You" screen is displayed.
