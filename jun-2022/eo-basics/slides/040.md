For the vast majority of voters, you will simply scan their driver's license.

Scanning a voter's driver license is very easy! You simply place the license in the scanning tray, which is attached to the back of the Poll Pad. Make sure the barcode is facing the Poll Pad camera. Then the Poll Pad will scan the barcode and open the voter's record automatically.

If this does not work or the voter provides a different form of acceptable ID, you can find them using a manual search.
