What if a voter requested a mailed absentee ballot, but then wants to vote in-person on election day?

The voter can bring their absentee ballot (marked or unmarked) and surrender it in exchange for a new ballot on election day. In this case, you would write "ABSENTEE SURRENDERED" across the face of the ballot.
