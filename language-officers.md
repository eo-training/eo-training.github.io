Language Officers are election officers, who in addition to performing all regular officer duties, may also assist voters in a language other than English.

Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act generally requires jurisdictions to provide language assistance to voters if more than 5% of voting-age citizens are members of a single-language minority group. In Fairfax County, we always assign Language Officers for **Spanish**, **Vietnamese**, and **Korean** in needed precincts. When possible, we also try to assign Language Officers in **Chinese**, **Arabic**, **Farsi**, **Hindi**, **Urdu**, **Russian**, and **ASL** in needed precincts.

To qualify as a Language Officer, an individual must pass an oral language skills assessment. We then assign Language Officers to precincts based on US Census data and voter feedback. About one-third of our precincts are assigned at least one Language Officer.

Additional notes:

* Language Officers are assigned every election, regardless of their party affiliation. For other officers, we must consider their party affiliation when making precinct assignments (e.g. in a single-party Democratic primary, we generally only assign Democratic officers).
* Language Officers are assigned before other officers.
* Language Officers must fluently speak English, in addition to their other language.
* Language officers will receive and wear a special name badge on election day which identifies them as a Language Officer and the language they speak.
* Language Officers receive the same stipend as regular officers.

## Language Officer Referral Bonus

Beginning with the June 2022 election, we are offering a language officer referral bonus for two languages: **Vietnamese** and **Korean**.

If you are a new or existing officer and refer someone who successfully serves as a Language Officer in one of these languages, you are eligible to receive a <span>$25</span> bonus stipend.

The new Language Officer receives the standard election officer stipend of <span>$175</span>.

**WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE REFERRAL BONUS?**

* Current and new Fairfax County election officers.
* Any election officer may receive the bonus, even if they are not assigned or do not serve in the next election.

**WHEN IS THE REFERRAL BONUS PAID**?

* The bonus will be paid with all other stipends, about 4-6 weeks after each election.
* A referring officer may earn a <span>$25</span> bonus for each new Language Officer they refer. For example, if someone refers 3 new Language Officers who meet all requirements, they would receive a <span>$75</span> bonus.

**WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REFERRAL BONUS TO BE EARNED?**

The referring officer must...

* Recruit an eligible person who has never previously applied or served as an officer in Fairfax County that would meet a specific and previously identified language need.
* Instruct the eligible person how to apply, making sure that they include the full name of the referring officer in their application.

The new Language Officer must...

* Be a currently registered Virginia voter.
* Submit the online [election officer application](https://www.vote4fairfax.com/apply/). **In the Comments section, make sure to put the full name of the person who referred you!**
* Pass an oral language skills assessment in-person or by telephone.
* Schedule and attend an in-person hiring paperwork appointment.
* Complete all training requirements for the next scheduled Fairfax County election.
* Serve in the next scheduled election as a Language Officer

**WHAT ARE EXAMPLES OF WHY A BONUS IS NOT EARNED AND PAID?**

* The new Language Officer is not a registered voter or does not meet the requirements to be an election officer.
* The new Language Officer does not fluently speak English, in addition to their second language.
* The new Language Officer does not pass the language skills assessment.
* The new Language Officer does not provide the name of the individual who referred them, either in their online application or within a short but reasonable period time afterwards (e.g. one week).
* The new Language Officer does not complete training in a timely manner.
* The new Language Officer cancels their assignment for any reason, does not serve for their full shift, or asks to change positions.
* The referral bonus program is suspended temporarily because the Language Officer recruitment goals have been met for the next scheduled Fairfax County election.
