Remember to select the appropriate check-in flag on the Poll Pad for:

- Voters without an acceptable ID who complete an ID Confirmation Statement,
- Voters marked as Inactive who complete the Affirmation of Eligibility form,
- Voters requiring assistance who complete a Request for Assistance form, and
- Curbside voters

Work with your officers to ensure this step isn't skipped!
