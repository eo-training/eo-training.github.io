There are 2 things to do the day before the election:

- **Chief receives Sheriff's Envelope**. On the day before the election, Sheriffs will deliver an envelope to the Chief's home between 6:00 AM and 2:00 PM. If you are not home, that's OK â€” they will post it at your front door. This envelope will contain final election materials. You must bring this envelope with you on election day! We suggest you put it in your black rolling kit, so you don't forget it.
- **Go to polling place, set up voting room.** The day before the election, the Chief and Assistant Chief should go to the polling place and do initial setup of the voting room. Invite any available officers to join you! You should set up the overall room, including the tables, chairs, handouts, and indoor signs (do not post the outside signs as they could be moved or removed before election morning). You are allowed to open the gray cart and inspect or use the contents inside as long as you seal it again before you leave. The only exception is for ballots and voting equipment - do NOT open these before election day!
