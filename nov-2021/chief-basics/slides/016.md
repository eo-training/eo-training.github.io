Voters can become "Inactive" if:

- They have moved, but did not update their voter registration.

How do you process an Inactive voter?

- First, ask the voter if they have moved. If the answer is yes, stop and use the Moving Conditions in the What-Ifs.
- Otherwise, simply ask the voter to complete an Affirmation of Eligibility form. Now the voter can be checked-in.
- On the Poll Pad, select the _Voter Signed Oath_ flag.

That's it! One form and one flag on the Poll Pad. There's no need to call the office for Inactive voters, but you can if you'd like help the first time.
