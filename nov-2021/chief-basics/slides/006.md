The week before the election, there are 4 things you need to do.

- **Attend the Chiefs Briefing**. This is required, by law, before each election in which you serve as a Chief or Assistant Chief. At the Chiefs Briefing, you will learn about new laws and procedures that affect that election.
- **Visit your polling place.** Sometime the week before the election, the Chief should visit the polling place to meet with building staff and see the voting room. The Chief should also verify your gray supply cart, DS200 scanners, and disassembled absentee ballot drop box have arrived. The Assistant Chief should attend too, if possible.
- **Chief picks up election materials.** Chiefs will be asked to schedule a time to pick up election materials. Notably, Chiefs will receive a black rolling kit (with election documents and forms) as well as their precinct's Poll Pads.
- **Chief contacts election officers.** The week before the election, the Chief should send an email or call all election officers to go over basic information. This includes making sure each officer is still working, they know where the building is, they know which entrance to use, and they know which room is the voting room. If any officers say they are no longer able to serve, let the main office know immediately.
