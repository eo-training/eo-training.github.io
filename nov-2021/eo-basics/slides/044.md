Let's go over some check-in tips to help process voters efficiently.

- If a voter has a driver's license, scan their ID, as it helps ensure accuracy. It may take 5-10 seconds for the Poll Pad to pull up their record, so be patient!
- If you are having trouble with glare on the ID, simply tilt the Poll Pad. The base is adjustable! You may also want to try creating a shadow with your hand or a piece of paper.
- If a Poll Pad freezes, use a different device to check in the voter.
- Remember: Do not issue a voter permit card (or a ballot) until the confirmation screen is displayed.
