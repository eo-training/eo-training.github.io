Once a voter is checked in, they will either receive a ballot to be hand-marked or an ExpressVote card.

If a voter chooses to use the ExpressVote ballot marking device, they will be issued a blank ExpressVote card to insert into the machine. Once the voter makes their selections, the ExpressVote will print a marked ballot card that voters can then scan themselves. This printed ballot card is equivalent to a regular ballot.

To be counted, either of these ballot types must then be inserted into a DS200 scanner.
