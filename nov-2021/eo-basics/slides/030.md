Here are some additional samples of documents that are valid for voting purposes:

- A current bank statement (with voter name and address)
- A current utility bill (with voter name and address)
- A current government check (with voter name and address)
- A current government document (with voter name and address)

Note that the Code of Virginia states that all of these documents must be "current" - this is considered as issued within the last 12 months.

If you're unsure about a particular ID, ask your Chief or Assistant Chief! They receive additional training on how to handle non-routine voter situations.
