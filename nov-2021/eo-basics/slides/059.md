At 7:00 PM (or after the last voter leaves), the Chief will lock the voting room and begin closing procedures. The following tasks must be completed before you can leave:

1. Fill out all required documents, including the Statement of Results and the Machine Certification Form.
2. Close and pack the Poll Pads.
3. Close and pack the ExpressVote.
4. Close and pack the DS200 scanners.
5. Secure all voted ballots and unvoted ballots, and
6. Remove and pack all signs and supplies.

NOTE: Absentee Ballot Collector officers will secure absentee ballots from the drop box, collect the flash drives from the DS200s, and immediately drive them to the Government Center. They are the only officers who will leave the polling place early.
