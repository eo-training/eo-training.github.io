There are also many IDs that you cannot accept for voting.

- A Virginia driver's license is OK, but an out-of-state driver's license is not.
- A Virginia driver privilege card, which would be issued to a non-citizen, is not accepted for voting.
- A US passport is OK, but a foreign passport is not.
- A photo ID from a person's employer is OK, but IDs from other organizations—such as a credit card or Costco membership card—are not OK.
