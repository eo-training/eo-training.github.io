Let's do a quick review. Which of these IDs is acceptable? Which is not? Why? Take a moment to think about these questions before you read the answer below.

- **TOP LEFT:** This is a work ID, but it does not have a photo. That means it is **not acceptable**.
- **TOP RIGHT:** This is a Maryland driver's license. This is an out-of-state license, which is not on the list of valid IDs. Therefore, it is **not acceptable**.
- **BOTTOM LEFT:** This is a school ID from the University of North Florida. As this is a United States university and has a photo, it is **acceptable**.
- **BOTTOM RIGHT:** This is a voter ID. You may see the 2014 date and think that automatically disqualifies it. However, remember the date that is listed is an _issue_ date, not an expiration date. So this ID is **acceptable** for voting.
