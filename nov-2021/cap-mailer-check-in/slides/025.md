Some voters have indicated on their absentee ballot applications that they will need assistance to complete their voter statements and/or to mark their ballots. The letters NA (Needs Assistance) will appear on the right side of the voter information label.

If assistance is requested, the voter will receive a blue "Request for Assistance" form. In most cases, a completed blue form will be returned in the mailer along with the ballot. If you see the NA designation on a voter's information label, do NOT process this mailer. Place the mailer in the "Not Processed" table box.

Of course, there is always an exception!

When reviewing the return mailer of a Needs Assistance (NA) voter, you may observe that the voter actually signed the voter statement. Perhaps this voter no longer needs assistance or the original request for the form was made in error. If the voter signed the voter statement, a Request for Assistance form is NOT required. In this case, the mailer may be checked in. You, of course, must ensure that the _Statement of Absentee Voter_ is completed correctly with no material omissions.
