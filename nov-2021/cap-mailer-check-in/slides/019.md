Once you are sure that the authorized absentee voter has completed the voter statement (i.e., the voter information label and the _Statement of Absentee Voter_ information agree), the voter statement must be reviewed for material omissions.

1. The voter statement must be filled out correctly and completely. It must contain:

- Voter's name
- Voter's address
- Voter's signature
- Witness signature
- A date is NOT required.

If any required information is missing, place the mailer in the "Not Processed" table box.
