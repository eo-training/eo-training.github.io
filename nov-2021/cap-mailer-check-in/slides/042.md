As mentioned, you now have approximately 50 scanned mailers in the "Saved in VERIS" table box. Each voter's status has been updated to "Marked".

What's next? It's déjà vu all over again! You must now re-scan each of these mailers and update the voter's status to "Pre-Processed". The "Pre-Processed" status indicates that the voter's _Statement of Absentee Voter_ is complete and correct. The voter has fulfilled all requirements for his or her ballot to be counted.

Step 12. Remove all ballots from the "Saved in VERIS" table box. Re-scan the barcode on the first mailer.

- Is this the correct voter?
- Ensure the voter's ballot _Status_ indicates "Pre-Processed".
- Place mailer, facedown, in a separate pile.
