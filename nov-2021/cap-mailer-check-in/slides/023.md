The image shows the front side of a UOCAVA return mailer. UOCAVA stands for Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. The UOCAVA return mailer will contain a standard digital ballot.

A UOCAVA submission is sent to the Office of Elections by an authorized absentee voter who is living overseas or by military personnel living anywhere.

Note that the front of a UOCAVA mailer looks similar to the front of a standard domestic mailer. The reverse side of the UOCAVA mailer looks very different.
