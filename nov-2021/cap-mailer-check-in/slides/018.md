A critical mailer check-in task is to verify that the authorized absentee voter has completed the _Statement of Absentee Voter_. Therefore, it is very important that the voter's name and address on the voter information label match the information provided by the voter on the mailer.

Typically, the _Statement of Absentee Voter_ and the voter information label will contain the same voter information...but not always.

If you encounter a mismatch between the voter information label and the voter's statement, do not process this ballot. Place the mailer in the "Not Processed" table box.
