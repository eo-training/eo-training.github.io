Step 1. Ensure that the VERIS screen shows the _Received Date_ and the _Received By Method_ fields.

Step 2. The team leader provides a red tray, containing domestic and/or UOCAVA mailers. All mailers will have scannable barcodes. The red tray will be labeled with the correct _Received Date_. Change the date in VERIS to the date indicated on the red tray. Red trays will contain mailers that have been received by the same method. Ensure that the VERIS _Received by Method_ is correct.

Step 3. Count out a set of 50 mailers, then quickly "eyeball" each mailer in the set and remove any email ballots (because these do not have scannable bar codes) and any Unused mailers. Place these in the "Not Processed" table box.
