Periodically, you will not be able to use the "Batch"method to scan mailers and check voters into VERIS; for example, when receiving a mailer from a voter who has requested an email ballot.

As you have already learned, a voter living overseas or military personnel living anywhere may request to receive their ballot by email. The voter uses templates in a PDF attachment to create their ballot and their return mailer. Once printed, the voted ballot must be inserted into the return mailer and mailed back to the Office of Elections.

This mailer does **not** have a preprinted voter information label with a barcode. You will need to check this voter into VERIS manually.
