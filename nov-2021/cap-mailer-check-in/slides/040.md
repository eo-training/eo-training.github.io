After scanning the barcode, you will hear a "beep". The beep indicates that the barcode has been successfully scanned. The voter's name will appear in the name field. The _Status_ indicates "Marked" and the _Status Reason_ indicates "Ballot Returned". If you do not see the correct voter's name or the status/reason fields indicate anything other than "Marked" and "Ballot Returned", call the team leader.

Step 6. Verify voter's name on the VERIS screen. Have you located the correct voter?

Step 7. Confirm ballot status has been updated to "Marked". A "Marked" status indicates that the voter's ballot has been received at the Office of Elections.

Step 8. Place the scanned mailer, facedown, and begin a separate pile. By doing so, you will keep the scanned mailers separated from those awaiting scanning.
