Once you've clicked on "All batch receipt-without IDs", the _Date Received_ and _Received by Method_ fields should appear. _Date Received_ defaults to the current date. The date can be changed as needed by clicking on the calendar icon to the right of the date received box. For example, if you're checking in mail received earlier in the week, use the calendar icon to the right of the box and click on the appropriate date.

For the _Received by Method_, click on the arrow to the right of the box to select the appropriate method of receipt. If scanning mailers delivered by USPS, FEDEX, DHL or UPS select "Mail". If scanning drop box return mailers, select "Drop-off".

Make sure to select the appropriate _Received by Method_ based on whether the return mailers were received by mail or from voter drop box locations. If you are unsure, check with the team leader.

When the information in both fields is correct, you're ready to begin batch scanning the return mailers.

But there are some important steps that must be followed before you can actually put the scanner to the mailer.
