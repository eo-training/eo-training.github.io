The Office of Elections staff reviews and sorts mailers as they arrive at the Government Center. They attach an appropriate sticker and set aside any unused voter packets, Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots (FWABs), and voided mailers. Typically, these will not be seen by the mailer check-in staff.

However, if one slips into one of your trays of mailers, place it in the "Not Processed" table box. Do not attempt to find this voter in VERIS or to process the ballot.
