Please take a moment to review these principles.

As we plan for and conduct each election, we follow these four guiding principles to maintain the integrity of the election. These principles direct each step and action we take.

It is important for you, as members of the mailer check-in staff, to read, understand, and embody these principles, to perform all duties assigned to you by the Office of Elections, and to do so faithfully, diligently, and impartially.
