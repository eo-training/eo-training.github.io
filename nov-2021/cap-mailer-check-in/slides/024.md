The reverse side of a UOCAVA mailer includes the voter information label and the voter statement, just as on the domestic mailer; however, the _Statement of Absentee UOCAVA Voter_ is very different.

No address is required. No date is required. In fact, the voter does not even have to provide a printed name.

What is required? Typically, only the voter's signature and the signature of a witness. If either of these two signatures is missing, the mailer cannot be processed. Place the mailer in the "Not Processed" table box.
