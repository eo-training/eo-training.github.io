The main functions of mailer check-In staff include:

- Reviewing mailers to remove any mis-sorted mailer types (digital or email) and unused or undeliverable submissions.
- Examining mailers to ensure that an authorized voter has provided a correct and complete voter statement and then making an important determination: to "process" or "not process."
- Locating a voter in VERIS
- Updating a voter's ballot status.
- Managing mailers
- Maintaining the Mailer Count worksheet.

During this training, we provide the "best practices" to accomplish each function of the mailer check-in operation. These "best practices" will serve as a roadmap to effectiveness and efficiency within the framework of election integrity.
