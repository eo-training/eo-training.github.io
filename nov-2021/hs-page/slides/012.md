Please bring everything you will need for your shift.  Unless emergency circumstances require it, you may not leave the polling place during your shift.  Bring food, snacks, homework (you can bring your laptop).  Remember, **only** if the Chief gives you permission during a slow period with low voter turnout, can you read or do your schoolwork.
