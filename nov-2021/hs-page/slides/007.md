After this session, you will know the answers to the following questions...How long do I work? What should I wear? What should I bring? And what will I be doing?

Let’s answer the first question now…When you fill out your application, you will choose between two 8-hr shifts:  5 a.m. – 1 p.m. or 12:30 p.m. – 8:30 p.m.

Your Election Day assignment will include the shift you have chosen plus give you the name and address of your polling place.
