Under the direction of the Chief, the morning pages will help with the following tasks:  Posting signs, arranging furniture,  and other election materials.  This may include personal protective equipment (PPE). The Chief may also ask you to help mark social distancing spots to help voters maintain social distance while they wait in line to vote.

You may be asked to help arrange the placement of the voting machines and privacy booths that are used to mark the ballots.

Additionally, you may be tasked with making sure that the path that voters will follow from the parking lot into the building and to the voting room is clear from any obstruction or hazard that may cause problems for people with wheelchairs, canes, or walkers. Fairfax County polling places must be accessible to ALL voters.
