Here is the digital scanning machine referred to as the DS200.  After voters mark their paper ballot, they place it in the scanner. The scanner captures an image of the ballot, records the votes, and informs the voter that their ballot has been cast. The machine lets the voter know immediately if the ballot is blank or over-voted (more selections made than the contest allows). All voters use paper ballots providing a paper trail for every vote in case of a recount.
