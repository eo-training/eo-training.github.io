In each election, some officers are eligible for mileage reimbursement:

- **Chiefs** are eligible for mileage reimbursement for picking up election materials before election day and returning election materials on election night.
- **Collector Officers** officers are eligible for mileage reimbursement for returning election materials on election night.

## Mileage reimbursement calculations

After consultation with the Department of Finance, the Office of Elections had to update how we calculate mileage reimbursements to be fully compliant with all county policies and procedures. If we did not make these changes, we could not issue mileage reimbursements for this election.
