title: "Ballot Preparation and Reconciliation"
---

After all the voter submissions in a set have been preprocessed, both team members will work together to prepare the ballots for proper storage in security cases.   

In addition, the team must reconcile the number of processed ballots with the number of voters (B envelopes) entered into VERIS.  These counts must be equal.  The Ballot Count worksheet is used for this purpose.

It is the responsibility of the Ballot Officer to complete the Ballot Count worksheet, although collecting the necessary information is a collaborative effort .
