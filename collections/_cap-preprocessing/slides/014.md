The main function of the Ballot Count Worksheet is to reconcile the number of voters a team has checked-in on VERIS with the number of ballots processed by that team. These counts must be equal.

The Ballot Count Worksheet is also a useful tool to record a team's progress throughout their shift.

It is the Ballot Officer's responsibility to ensure that the Ballot Count Worksheet is completed correctly.
