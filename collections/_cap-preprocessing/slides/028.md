Note the "ID Required" designation which appears on the preprinted return address label in this image. This voter has registered by mail, so he must present an identification document (ID) before voting for the first time.

The Office of Election staff will review and verify acceptable ID documents before the mailers arrive at preprocessing. If the ID is acceptable, the staff will place an "ID Verified" sticker near the address label on the mailer. These ballots may be preprocessed..

Remember, as always, the B envelope must be completed correctly with no material omissions. And, as always, if there are material omissions, place the mailer with all contents in the "Not Processed" table box.

If you encounter an "ID Required" mailer without an "ID Verified" sticker, place the mailer with all contents in the "Not Processed" table box.
