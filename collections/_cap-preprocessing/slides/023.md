What is an acceptable address on the B envelope?

- An address must include the voter's house/building number and the street name. An apartment or unit number is not required.
- A voter must provide the city OR the zip code
- A voter may not provide a Post Office Box (POB) or a Personal Mail Box (PMB) on the B envelope.

If a voter has provided an address on the B envelope that is different from his registered address in VERIS, place the mailer with all contents in the "Not Processed" table box.
