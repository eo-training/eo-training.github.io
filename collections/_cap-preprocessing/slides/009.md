Safeguarding voter and ballot information is the responsibility of every preprocessor.  You may not communicate any information you see or hear to any unauthorized person while preprocessing is in session as well as when you leave the preprocessing area. 

That includes:
*  Not posting on any social media.
*  Not using your cell phone at the workstations, and especially while handling any voter or ballot information.
*  Not taking photos while in preprocessing.           
*  Not connecting to the Internet while in a CAP preprocessing room.
