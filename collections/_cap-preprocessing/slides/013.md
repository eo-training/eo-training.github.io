title: "Ballot Processing Teams â€“ 2 Staff Members"
---

Preprocessing is conducted by teams of 2 staff members:  a Ballot Officer and a VERIS officer.  It is a best practice to become familiar with the responsibilities and functions of each team member, allowing for flexibility during the day.

The Ballot Officer initially reviews the voter submission batch to look for mis-sorted ballot types (digital or email), mismatched congressional districts (CD)s or delegate districts, Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots (FWABs), and unused or undeliverable submissions.  The Ballot Officer next examines the B envelope for completeness and makes an initial determination to accept or "not process."  The Ballot Officer then clearly reads the name and address from the B envelope so the VERIS Officer can locate the voter in VERIS.  The Ballot Officer is also responsible for managing mailing materials and ballots and maintaining the Ballot Count worksheet. 

The VERIS Officer also reviews the voter submissions and examines the B envelopes.  It is very important that both officers have "eyes on" every voter submission!  The VERIS Officer then locates, verifies, and checks in voters on VERIS, and assists with overall ballot management.

The two officers work closely together during preprocessing.  Good communication and teamwork are essential to ensure accuracy and positive (2 person) control at all times during preprocessing
