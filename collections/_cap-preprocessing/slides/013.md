You will find two valuable reference guides at your workstation.

- The Material Omissions chart is a comprehensive, user-friendly table outlining acceptable/unacceptable standards for the review of B envelopes. A material omission is a voter's failure to provide complete and correct information on his B envelope or a failure to properly submit his ballot. Such actions will render that ballot unqualified for counting.

 As a preprocessor, you are expected to make important decisions regarding the acceptance of a voter's ballot based on the information provided by the voter on his B envelope. These decisions must be made fairly and consistently. If there is any question about the information on a voter's B envelope, the answer can usually be found in the Material Omissions chart.

 However, if you are ever in doubt, ask the preprocessing shift leader.

- The HAVA (Help America Vote Act) guidelines are used when reviewing submissions from voters who must provide an acceptable form of identification with their ballot. Refer to these guidelines to determine if the voter has submitted an acceptable form of ID. Note that this task is typically completed by other election staff members prior to preprocessing.
