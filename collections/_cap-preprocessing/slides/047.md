As each batch of 10 mailers is successfully preprocessed and saved, rubber band the batch and place it in the "Saved in VERIS" table box.

Continue preprocessing the remaining batches in the set. Remember to scan one batch of 10 mailers at a time and be sure to click "Save" at the end of each batch.

When all the mailers in the entire set have been preprocessed, it is time to prepare the ballots and begin reconciliation.
