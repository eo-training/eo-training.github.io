title: "Cured Voter Submissions"
---

Virginia state law offers an absentee voter the opportunity to correct a material omission on the B envelope.  If a voter has provided incorrect or incomplete information on the B envelope that would cause it to be disallowed, the Office of Elections will notify the voter of the material omission and further stipulate how to correct the issue so the ballot may be counted. This is called the "curing" process.

Some absentee voters may opt to come, in person, to the Office of Elections to "cure" their submission.

Others may choose to provide (by mail, email), a signed affidavit containing the corrected information.  When this affidavit arrives at the Office of Elections it will be placed in the voterâ€™s original mailer with the original B envelope.  In this case, preprocessors may review the information in the affidavit for material omissions and use the affidavit information to check-in the voter on VERIS. 

Note that it may be necessary to review the affidavit in conjunction with the original B envelope.  For example, if the voter forgot the city or zip code on the original B envelope and then submitted an affidavit with only the corrected city/zip code, preprocessors may look at both components to determine completeness.
