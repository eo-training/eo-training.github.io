What is an acceptable address on the B envelope?

1.  An address must include the voterâ€™s house/building number and the street name.  An apartment or unit number is not required.
2.  A voter must provide the city OR the zip code.
3.  A voter may not provide a Post Office Box (POB) or a Personal Mail Box (PMB) on the B envelope. 

If a voter has provided an address on the B envelope that is different from the registered address in VERIS, place the mailer with all contents in the "Not Processed" table box.
