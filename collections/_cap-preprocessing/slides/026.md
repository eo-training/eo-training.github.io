The UOCAVA B envelope, however, is very different from a domestic B envelope.

No address is required. No date is required. In fact, the voter does not even have to provide a printed name.

What is required? Typically, only the voter's signature and the signature of the witness. If either of these two signatures is missing, the ballot cannot be processed (the witness signature requirement has been waived for the November 3, 2020, election). Place the mailer with all contents in the "Not Processed" table box.
