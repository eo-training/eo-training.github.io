During preprocessing operations, ballot processing is completed by teams of 2 staff members: a Ballot Officer and a VERIS officer. It is a best practice to become familiar with the responsibilities and functions of each team member, allowing for flexibility during the day.

The Ballot Officer manages the voters' mailed-in materials, including ballots, conducts the review process of the B envelopes, and maintains the required recording documentation.

The VERIS Officer locates, verifies, and checks in voters on VERIS and assists with ballot management.

The two officers work closely together during preprocessing. Good communication and teamwork are essential.
