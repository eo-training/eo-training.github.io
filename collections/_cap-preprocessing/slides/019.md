The domestic B envelope is found inside the domestic outer mailer. The ballot must be inside the B envelope. The B envelope does not have to be sealed.

The information on the B envelope is very important:

* The Ballot officer reviews the information on the B envelope to determine if any material omissions are present.

* The Ballot officer also reads the voter's name and address from the B envelope so the VERIS officer can locate the voter in VERIS on the computer.

Possible circumstances:

* What if there is no B envelope? This is a material omission; you may not process this ballot. Place the mailer with all contents in the "Not Processed" table box.

* What If the ballot is not inside the B envelope? This is also a material omission. Do not process this ballot. Place the mailer with all contents in the "Not Processed" table box.

* What if there are two B envelopes in one mailer? Both B envelopes may be evaluated for material omissions and both voters may be checked-in.
