title: "Domestic Ballot Return Mailer"
---

This image is an example of the most common type of return mailer submission:  the Domestic Ballot Return Mailer. In CAP, this is often simply referred to as the "mailer". 

The domestic ballot return mailer is supplied by the Office of Elections.  The voter puts a completed ballot in the B envelope and puts that B envelope inside the return mailer.  

Experienced preprocessors will note the absence of the preprinted return address label with a scannable bar code on the mailer.   This preprinted label is now on the B envelope inside the return mailer. 

Each return mailer will have a small, color-coded block at the upper edge of the front of the mailer to indicate the CD in which the voter resides.  Also note the ## symbols next to the green square.  If there is a contest on the ballot relevant to a particular delegate district, the number designation of that district will appear here.
