Once the Ballot Officer is sure that the correct authorized voter has completed the B envelope (i.e. the mailing label and B envelope information agree), he must review the B envelope for material omissions.

1. The B envelope must be filled out correctly and completely. It must contain:

* Voter's name

* Voter's address

* Voter's signature

* Witness signature (This has been waived for the November 3, 2020 election)

- A date is NOT required.

If any required information is missing, place the mailer with all its contents in the "Not Processed" table box.

If there are no material omissions present on the B envelope, the VERIS officer can find this voter in the VERIS database. Once again, it is important to verify the identity of the voter. The information on the B envelope must also match the information in VERIS.

If there are any discrepancies in VERIS, place the mailer with all its contents in the "Not Processed" box.
