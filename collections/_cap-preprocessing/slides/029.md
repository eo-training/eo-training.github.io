title: "UOCAVA B Envelopes"

The UOCAVA B envelope, however, is very different from a domestic B envelope.

No address is required.  No date is required.  In fact, the voter does not even have to provide a printed name.

What is required?  Typically, only the voterâ€™s signature and the signature of the witness (the witness signature requirement is waived if there is a declared public health emergency, such as for the June 2021 election).  If either of these two signatures is missing, the ballot cannot be processed.   Place the mailer with all contents in the "Not Processed" table box.
