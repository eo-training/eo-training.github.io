This image is an example of the most common type of outer mailer submission: the Domestic Ballot Mailer.

The domestic ballot mailer is supplied by the Office of Elections and contains a preprinted return address label on the front side of the envelope.

Please note the information on the preprinted return address label, circled on the image. It includes the following:

* Scannable bar code specific to the voter. This bar code can be scanned to quickly locate the voter in VERIS

* Voter's ID number

* Voter's name

* Voter's address

* The current election

* Voter's Congressional District (CD) and Precinct designations

* Indication whether extra documentation is required
