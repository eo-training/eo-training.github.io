The Office of Elections staff quickly reviews and sorts mailers as they arrive at the Government Center. They attach an appropriate sticker and set aside any unused voter packets, Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots (FWABs), and voided mailers. Typically, these will not be seen by preprocessors.

However, if one slips into one of your batches of mailers, give it to the shift leader. Do not attempt to find this voter in VERIS or to process the ballot.
