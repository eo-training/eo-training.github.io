title: "Voter Submission – A Voter in an Envelope"
---

On election day, when a voter arrives at the polling location, the voter provides his/her name and address, and presents identification, all before casting a ballot.  Of course, the process is very different for an authorized absentee voter who is submitting a ballot by mail or in a drop box.

An authorized absentee voter who is taking advantage of the Vote By Mail option must return a voter submission that typically contains three components:
A return mailer
A B envelope inside the return mailer (A B envelope is an envelope with the "Statement of Absentee Voter" on the outside)
A ballot inside the B envelope

An authorized absentee voter who is taking advantage of the drop box option may choose to forego use of the return mailer.  However, this voter must return the ballot in a B envelope.

These components may look different based on the status and location of the voter, but they will always be there. 
  
For preprocessors, the B envelope is critical.  The B envelope represents the absentee voter.  On the B envelope, the voter is stating his/her name and address.  In lieu of presenting identification, the voter provides a signature attesting that the information is correct. 

Note that in some instances, a voter must provide additional documentation. We will discuss these specific instances later.
