Safeguarding voter and ballot information is the responsibility of every preprocessor. You may not communicate any information you see or hear in CAP to any unauthorized person while CAP is in session.

That includes:

* Not posting on any social media while CAP is in session (that includes morning shift preprocessors after they have departed).

* Not using your cell phone while handling any voter or ballot information.

* Not taking photos while in CAP.

* Not connecting to the Internet while in a CAP preprocessing room.
