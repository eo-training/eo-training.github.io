title: "Evaluating the B Envelope"
---

Once the Ballot Officer is sure that the correct authorized absentee voter has completed the B envelope (i.e., the voter information label and B envelope information agree),  the B envelope must be reviewed for material omissions.

1.    The B envelope must be filled out correctly and completely.  It must contain:
*     Voter’s name
*     Voter’s address
*     Voter’s signature
*     Witness signature  Please note:  A witness signature is waived during a declared public health emergency so is not required for the June 2021 election.  For elections occurring after June 2021, refer to guidance from your team leader whether a waiver is in place.

2.   A date is NOT required.

If any required information is missing, place the mailer with all its contents in the "Not Processed" table box.

If there are no material omissions, the VERIS officer may find this voter in the VERIS database.  Once again, it is important to verify the identity of the voter.  The information on the B envelope must also match the information in VERIS.

If there are any discrepancies in VERIS, place the mailer with all its contents in the "Not Processed" box.
