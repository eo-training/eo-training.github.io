These training materials will prepare you for any upcoming election.

However, if you are reviewing this material in advance of the November 2020 General Election, note that the county is continuing to execute the Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19 within the Government Center, where preprocessing will take place.

In addition, the Office of Elections will supply preprocessing teams with gloves, face masks, and hand sanitizer. We are working diligently to ensure appropriate social distancing as well as limiting the number of staff inside the preprocessing rooms.

Of course, if any staff member is ill, please stay home to protect the health of others. If you become ill while on the job, you will be sent home.
