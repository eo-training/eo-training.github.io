These training materials have been developed to prepare you for any upcoming election.

However, if you are reviewing this material in advance of the June 8, 2021 Primary Elections, it is important that you are aware of the countyâ€™s Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19.  

Fairfax County remains focused on providing a safe, supportive, and healthy work environment and is continuously revising and updating its COVID-19 guidelines.  The Office of Elections will ensure that applicable, current information regarding any changes is passed on to preprocessors before operations begin.

In addition, the Office of Elections will supply preprocessing teams with gloves, face masks, and hand sanitizer as well as surface cleaning supplies.  We are working diligently to ensure appropriate social distancing and to limit the number of staff inside the preprocessing rooms.

Of course, in order to protect the health of others, if any staff member is ill, please stay home.  If you become ill while on the job, you will be sent home.

And we want to make sure you stay safe and healthy; we hope everyone has been able to receive or schedule their COVID vaccine!
