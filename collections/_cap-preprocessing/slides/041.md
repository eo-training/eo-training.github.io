In order to access the VERIS database, you must first log into Fairfax County using your county logon credentials. Click the VERIS icon on the desktop and then sign into VERIS, using your VERIS logon credentials.

Please note: It is important to remember both your Fairfax County username/password as well as your VERIS username/password.

At the end of your shift, of course, be sure to log out of VERIS and sign out of the Fairfax County system.
