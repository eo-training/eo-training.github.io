The image shows a UOCAVA mailer. UOCAVA stands for Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. The UOCAVA mailer will contain a special UOCAVA B envelope with a standard digital ballot inside.

A UOCAVA mailer is used by an authorized absentee voter who is living overseas or by military personnel living anywhere.

The UOCAVA mailer is similar to the domestic mailer. It comes from the Office of Elections and contains the preprinted return address label. The only difference is that the acronym "UOCAVA" appears on the front of the mailer in a white block at the top of the turquoise band.
