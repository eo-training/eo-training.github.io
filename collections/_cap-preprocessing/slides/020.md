Before processing a ballot, you must ensure that the correct authorized absentee voter has completed the B envelope. Therefore, it is very important that the voter's name and address on the address label match the information on the B envelope.

Typically, the B envelope and the outer mailer's address label will contain the same voter informationâ€¦but not always.

Note the example on the image. According to the address label on the outer mailer, Howard Fienberg is the authorized absentee voter. A ballot was sent to Howard Fienberg. However, it appears that the B envelope was completed by Julius Fienberg.

If you encounter this type of mismatch between the mailing label and the B envelope, do not process this ballot. Place the mailer with all contents in the "Not Processed" table box.
