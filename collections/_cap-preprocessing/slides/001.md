Welcome to the Fairfax County Office of Elections, Central Absentee Precinct's online training class for Pre-election Ballot Processing.

This course is designed to provide new preprocessors with the knowledge required to successfully participate in the ballot processing operations that occur prior to election day.

And to our returning preprocessors: Welcome back! We hope that this course will serve as a valuable tool to reinforce your preprocessing skills. Please do take some time to review the new VERIS procedures with which you may not be familiar. As always, we look to you to share your knowledge and insight with our new team members.
