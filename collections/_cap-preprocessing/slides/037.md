Once the Ballot Officer has verified that the voter's address label information matches the B envelope **and** has determined that the B envelope is complete (with no material omissions), he can continue preprocessing.

- Scan the bar code on the outer mailer.

- Using the information on the B envelope, read the voter's name and address aloud to the VERIS Officer.

7. Listen for verbal confirmation from the VERIS Officer that:

* The correct voter has been located in VERIS (Typically, the VERIS Officer will read the voter's name aloud from the VERIS screen)

* The voter's ballot status has been updated to "Pre-Processed" in VERIS (Typically, the VERIS Officer will say "Preprocessed")

- Place the mailer with all contents in the "Saved in VERIS" table box.

- Follow the same procedures to preprocess the remaining mailers in the batch. When the last mailer in the batch has been preprocessed, the VERIS Officer will save the updated voter status information. Listen for verbal confirmation from the VERIS Officer that the changes have been saved. The VERIS Officer will say "Saved". This is critical!

- Reband the batch of mailers. Place the batch in the "Saved in VERIS" table box. Continue with the next batch of mailers.
