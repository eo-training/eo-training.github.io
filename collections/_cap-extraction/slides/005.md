Pre-processing phase 1, step 1 begins: the opening. The batched return mailers are kept in secure storage until it's time for the first step of pre-processing phase 1. A team of two election office staff transport to the work area only the number of batched return mailers that can be processed by extraction teams by the end of each workday.

The opening team uses the automatic envelope opening machine (Omation 360), taking care to ensure the enclosed ballot is not damaged. The opening team opens all return mailers in one batch before opening the next batch. Once the workday's batches of return mailers are opened, they're ready for step 2, which is actual ballot extraction.
