First, some background on how a voter can vote absentee. If a voter wishes to vote absentee, their first step is to submit, in writing, an absentee ballot application to the Fairfax County Office of Elections. The application must be mailed, emailed, or submitted through the Department of Elections online portal. An absentee ballot cannot be requested by telephone. When a voter's request is approved, an absentee ballot is sent to the requester within three business days once ballots have been printed.

After the voter receives and votes their ballot, they return it to the Office of Elections inside a sealed return mailer by various methods including:

- United States Postal Service (USPS)

- Commercial mail delivery service such as FedEx, DHL, or UPS

- Placed in a drop box at early voting locations during operating hours

- In the 24/7 drop box located outside the Fairfax County Government Center

- On election day, placed in a drop box at a polling place

- Hand delivered to Fairfax County Office of Elections, Suite 323
