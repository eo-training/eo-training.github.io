When extraction teams are ready, the Extraction Operation Supervisor places one batch of opened return mailers on each table. A batch averages 700-900 mailers contained in approximately 1-2 yellow trays.

From the tray, each team member takes a handful of return mailers and places the stack in front of them. Taking one mailer at a time, the folded ballot is removed from its return mailer. The still folded ballot is then placed into the box marked "ballots" and the empty return mailer placed in the box marked "mailer". Any visibly damaged or non-scannable ballots, e.g., bad stains, torn or crumpled ballots, missing timing marks, and so on are placed in the black tray. These non-scannable ballots cannot be scanned by the DS 850 and will be hand counted after the polls close on election day. The extraction process continues until the team's batch tray is empty. All extraction work is conducted on the tabletop. Return mailers and ballots must be always visible.
