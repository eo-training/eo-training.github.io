Once the table's batch tray is empty, each team member counts their stacks of folded ballots and return mailers.

Ballots and empty return mailers are counted separately, in groups of ten, crisscrossing each group of ten to create stacks of 50. The ballots are kept folded.

Once counts are completed, the numbers must be verified by a second person at the table. The stacks of folded ballots and return mailers remain in place. Team members physically switch to another seat at the table and count the stacks of ballots and return mailers in front of that seat. The first person's count must match the second person's count. If the counts do not match, the stacks are counted again until they do match. Counts must agree before moving on. After counts agree, ballots are unfolded and boxed, and mailers bundled in preparation for review by the Quality Assurance team.
