Now that the day's batches of return mailers have been opened, it's time to remove (extract) the enclosed folded ballot.

Extraction is done by teams of 2-4 people with one person designated as the table team leader. Team member duties include removing folded ballots from mailers, identification and proper handling of damaged ballots, accurate accounting of ballots and return mailers, and preparing (unfolding/nesting) ballots for scan team processing. A team member is also responsible for notifying their team leader when they come across a faulty return mailer. A faulty return mailer is one in which the contents are not as they should be, such as no ballot/empty mailer, two or more ballots in one mailer, containing only election information materials but no ballot, and so on. When this happens, the team member notifies their table team leader. The team leader notifies the Extraction Operation Supervisor who removes the faulty return mailer from the batch, directs the team leader to adjust the batch count, and forwards the faulty mailer to the Curing team.
