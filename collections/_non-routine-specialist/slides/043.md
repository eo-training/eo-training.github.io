This is a sample of the **Provisional Notice** and the **Provisional Ballots Log**.

The Chief will issue each provisional voter a copy of the **Provisional Notice** , which tells them more about how and when their provisional ballot will be adjudicated.

The Chief will also complete the **Provisional Ballots Log** after each provisional voter. The Chief must copy some basic information from the individual provisional envelope completed by each provisional voter.
