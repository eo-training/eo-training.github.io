WHAT IF THE VOTER HAS NO ACCEPTABLE ID?

Option 1: The voter can sign an ID Confirmation Statement and vote normally.

Option 2: The voter can cast a Provisional Ballot.

Option 3: The voter can leave the polling place and return with a valid ID.

Important Notes:

- Previously, all IDs required a photo. Now, the only ID that explicitly requires a photo is an employer ID.
- NEVER ask a voter to remove their face mask or religious face covering to verify their identity.
