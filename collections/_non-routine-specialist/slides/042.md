Let's continue the example with a voter who is already marked as having voted.

- Because this is NOT a no-ID provisional situation, you will use the **regular green** envelope.
- Here, the voter and Chief (or their designee) again complete the front of the envelope, including signatures from each person.
- In this situation, the Chief or his or her designee must also complete the back of the envelope - select a checkbox and write notes!
- Here, we have selected reason code #4 (voter applied for an absentee ballot but does not have the ballot) and wrote some notes at the top of the envelope to explain that the voter says they never received their absentee ballot.

Remember, any notes should be written or attached to the outside of the envelope, so the Electoral Board can review them before they make their decision.
