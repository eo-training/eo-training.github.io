If designated to do so by the Chief, you should be prepared to help monitor the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box.

Each polling place will receive one Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box that will be packed in a cardboard box. This Drop-Off Box will be used by voters who wish to deposit their completed absentee ballot envelopes.

Voters from anywhere in Fairfax County can return completed absentee ballot envelopes in a Drop-Off Box at any polling place.
