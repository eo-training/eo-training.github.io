You should assist other election officers who have questions about the new ID requirements.

The Virginia General Assembly passed legislation impacting the requirements for Voter IDs at polling places that took effect on July 1, 2020. If designated by the Chief to do so, the Non-Routine Specialist should be prepared to monitor Pollbook Officers and assist them with any questions about the new ID requirements.

On Election Day, Pollbook Officers will have a one-page list of all acceptable IDs that they can check at any time. All IDs that were previously acceptable can still be accepted.
