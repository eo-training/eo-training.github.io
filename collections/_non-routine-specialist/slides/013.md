Digital copies of some IDs are now acceptable: a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document with the voter's name and address.

Voters who choose to show the Pollbook Officer a digital copy of an acceptable ID will need to either:

Pass their phone or electronic device to the Pollbook Officer using the box lid that is used to pass IDs
 –OR–

Hold their electronic device up against the acrylic sneeze guard so that the Pollbook Officer may see the digital ID.
