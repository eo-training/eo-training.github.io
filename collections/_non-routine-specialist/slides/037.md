You should be familiar with the curbside voting process and should be prepared to answer questions from voters or Election Officers about the process.

If asked by your Chief, you should help ensure that two Officers, representing different political parties if possible, assist each curbside voter.

Some curbside voters may simply want to drop-off their completed absentee ballot. You should help ensure that two Election Officers accept any voted absentee ballots that are returned by curbside voters, and that the two Officers deposit those voted absentee ballots directly in the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box.

You should also help the Chief and Assistant Chief ensure that two Election Officers are stationed curbside at 7:00 p.m. and that any voter who is present curbside at 7:00 p.m. has the opportunity to vote.
