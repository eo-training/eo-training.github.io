If designated to do so by the Chief, you should be prepared to assist absentee voters who come to the polling place on Election Day. There are three potential scenarios involving voters who requested an absentee ballot but come to the polling place on Election Day:

**1. Voters who bring their completed absentee ballot and want to deposit it in the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box.**

**2. Voters who have their absentee ballot and want to vote in-person.**

We will go over this situation next.

**3. Voters who do not have their absentee ballot but want to vote in-person.**
 We will also go over this situation next.
