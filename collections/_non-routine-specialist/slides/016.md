As they have in the past, the Pollbook Officer will ask each voter:

" **What is your full legal name and current residential address?"**

However, after the Pollbook Officer determines that the voter is qualified, they will only repeat the voter's name. The Pollbook Officer will not repeat the voter's address.

**Again, the Pollbook Officer only repeats the voter's name.**

If designated to do so by the Chief, you will help monitor Pollbook Officers to make sure that they are only repeating the voter's name and that they are not repeating the voter's address.
