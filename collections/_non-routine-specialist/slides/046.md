Thank you for serving as a Non-Routine Specialist!

As you have learned, there are many things you can help with and you will be a valued resource to your Chief and Assistant Chief on election day.

However, please remember that you are not a manager, you do not supervise or direct Election Officers, you do not make any decisions concerning provisional voters, and you do not take the place of the Chief Officer or Assistant Chief Officer at any time or in any way.

If you have any questions, ask your Chief or contact the main office.
