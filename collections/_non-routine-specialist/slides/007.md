If designated to do so by the Chief, you should be prepared to monitor Pollbook Officers and help them determine when a voter should be referred to the Chief.

You should review the section of the Polling Place Manual on non-routine voters and provisional ballots to understand which situations require a voter to be referred to the Chief and which situations you may assist with.

NOTE: As the Non-Routine Specialist, you will **NOT** make any decisions about issuing provisional ballots to voters, moving conditions, or related matters.
