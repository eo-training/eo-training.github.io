You should help the Chief and Assistant Chief ensure that the yellow A-frame Curbside Voting sign is posted in a spot that is visible for voters approaching the curb.

You should also help ensure that the phone number posted on the sign is correct and that the phone used to receive calls from curbside voters has good reception in the voting room.

(If your polling place has public Wi-Fi, you should enable "Wi-Fi calling" on the phone used to receive calls from curbside voters for improved reception and call quality.)
