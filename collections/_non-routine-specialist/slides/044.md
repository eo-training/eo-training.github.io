This is a reminder that you should **NEVER** check-in provisional voters on your Poll Pad.

In addition, do **NOT** let voters cast provisional ballots on the DS200 scanner. It's very important to help provisional voters at a separate table, far away from the regular voting booths or the DS200 scanner. Once the Chief has issued a ballot to a provisional voter, you should stay with them until they return it to the Chief.
