What if a voter requested a mailed absentee ballot, but then comes to the polling place and wants to vote in-person?

First, let's look at the steps if the voter comes to the polling place WITH their absentee ballot.

- First, the voter should surrender their ballot to you. If it is still sealed in the envelope, ask them to open the envelope to verify the ballot is present. If the voter has made selections in any contest, ask them to fill in all bubbles for those contests, so no one knows who they intended to vote for.
- Next, you must write "absentee spoiled" across the face of the ballot. Place this ballot in envelope #4 with other spoiled and voided ballots.
- Now you may check-in the voter on the Poll Pad and allow them to vote a regular ballot.

Now let's look at the steps if the voter comes to the polling place WITHOUT their absentee ballot.

- This one is very straightforward: the Chief will simply offer the voter a provisional ballot.
- Staff will verify that the voter did not already vote an absentee ballot in-person or by mail.
