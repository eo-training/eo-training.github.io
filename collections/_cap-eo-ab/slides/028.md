The above is an example of the most common type of mailer submission:  the Domestic Ballot Return Mailer.   In CAP, this is often simply referred to as the "mailer".

The domestic ballot return mailer is supplied by the Office of Elections (the voter puts their completed ballot in their B envelope and puts that B envelope inside the return mailer).  

The preprinted voter information label is on the B envelope inside the return mailer.
