title: "Evaluating the B Envelope"

Once EO#1 is sure that the correct authorized voter has completed the B envelope (i.e., voter information label and B envelope information agree), review the B envelope for material omissions.

1.  The B envelope must be completed correctly and completely.  It must contain:

*  Voter’s name
*  Voter’s address 
*  Voter’s signature
*  Witness signature.  The witness signature requirement may be waived for declared public health emergencies.

2.  A date is NOT required.

3.      A witness signature is normally required.  Under certain conditions, such as a declared state pandemic or other emergency, the witness signature may be waived.  Your chief will let you know if there is a waiver in place for the witness signature requirement.

If there are no material omissions, EO#2 can find this voter in the EPB.  Once again, it is important to verify the identity of the voter.  The information on the B envelope must also match the information on the EPB.

If there are any discrepancies, CALL THE CHIEF.
