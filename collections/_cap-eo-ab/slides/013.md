There are two essential parts of election day which are (1) from opening to closing of the poll and (2) after closing of the poll.
 
During the day, EOs will spend much of their time processing mailed-in voter submissions, but may also assist with preparing ballots for scanning, with handcounting ballots, or whatever other tasks the chief may assign.  The shift change will typically occur between 1 and 1:30 p.m.
 
After the poll is closed, some EOs may continue processing voter submissions and others may assist in obtaining vote counts from scanning machines or handcounts, packing, sealing and signing boxes, moving boxes or equipment or general cleanup of the CAP area. Because voter submission processing by CAP will continue to noon on the Friday after election day, the CAP area will remain set-up for later processing.
