To search for a voter on the EPB:

Ensure that the EPB is in Advanced Search mode and that Absentee indicates "true".
Type the first 2 or 3 letters of the voter’s last name into last name field.  Press the "Search" button or hit the "Enter" key on your keyboard.  A list of possible voters will appear in center screen.
Find the correct voter.  Note the AB icon in front of the voter’s name, indicating that the voter is authorized to vote by mail.  
Note the voter’s Absentee Status in the last column.  

Finally, when you are ready to search for a different voter, remember to highlight the previous search information and just type over.
