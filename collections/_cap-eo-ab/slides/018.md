title: "Ballot Processing Teams – 2 EOs"
---

Three person EO teams are normally used, but it may be necessary at times to use two person EO teams.

For two person EO teams, the functions of the #3 EO are primarily rolled into the #2 EO position.  This process is described in Appendix D of the EO manual.

EO#1 is the Check-in Officer.  The Check-in officer will review the information on the voter’s B envelope to determine whether the information is complete.  The Check-in officer will also clearly read the name and address of the absentee voter from the B envelope to…

EO#2, who is the EPB Officer.  The EPB Officer locates the correct absentee voter in the electronic poll book, verifies that the information on the voter’s B envelope is correct, and checks the voter in on the EPB. 

Once EO#2 checks the voter in on the EPB and verbally confirms that the check-in is complete, EO#1 opens the B envelope and passes the voter’s complete submission packet to EO#2.  EO#2 removes the ballot from the B envelope and places it, FOLDED, in the appropriate ballot box.
