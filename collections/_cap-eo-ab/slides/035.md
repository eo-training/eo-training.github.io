What is an acceptable address on the B envelope? 

 1.  An address must include the voterâ€™s house or building number and the street name.  An apartment or unit number is NOT required.

 2.  A voter must provide the city OR the zip code.

 3.  A voter may NOT provide a Post Office Box (POB) or Personal MailBox (PMB) on the B envelope.

More things to remember:

If a voter has provided an address on the B envelope that is different than his registered address in the EPB, CALL THE CHIEF.  

In a few instances, you will find a POB or PMB for a voter on the electronic poll book.  CALL THE CHIEF.  You have encountered a protected voter.  The chief will provide further instructions.
