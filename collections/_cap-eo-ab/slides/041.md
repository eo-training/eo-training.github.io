title: "Rejected Ballot Mailer"
---

When an EO team determines that a voterâ€™s ballot will be rejected:

EO#1 completes a rejected sticker explaining the material omission and affixes the sticker to the bottom left-hand corner of the mailer.  All three EOs must sign. 
 
**Do not remove the ballot from the B envelope**.  After signing the rejected sticker, EO#3 places the mailer with all contents intact into the "Rejected Ballots" table box.

After the election, these voters will receive photocopies of their mailer and B envelope with an explanation as to why their ballot was rejected.
