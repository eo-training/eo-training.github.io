title: "Acceptable Names"
---

Let’s take a moment to discuss what is acceptable in the name field on the B envelope.  To demonstrate, we will use a voter named Robert Matthew Jones.  

1.  The voter must include his full first name and full last name.  For example: Robert Jones.  However, a voter may provide only the initial of his first name if a full middle name is included. For example:   R. Matthew Jones.

2.  The voter may include his name in an order different than "first, middle, last". For example:  Jones, Robert.

3.  A middle name is not required, or a middle initial may be substituted. For example:  Robert M. Jones.

4.  A voter may provide a recognized nickname.  For example:  Bob Jones.

5.  Be cautious when generational suffixes ( Jr., Sr., I, II, III) are included.  Ensure that you are checking in the correct voter.
