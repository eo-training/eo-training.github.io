Vote in person early or by requesting a ballot to mail in.
 
Download a copy of the EO manual and study it.

Take both training modules for CAP AB and handcounting and one quiz. 
 
Be on time – we need three EOs for every team to process ballots.
 
If you can’t serve, call us immediately.
 
If you have any doubts or questions about a B envelope or any other task you are asked to perform, CALL the CHIEF.  Better to ask questions than possibly disenfranchise a voter.
 
Use your reference materials – don’t guess.
 
Bring everything you might need for the entire day or shift.
