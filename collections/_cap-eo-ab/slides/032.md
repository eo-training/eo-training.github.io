title: "Matching Voter Information on B Envelope"
---

Before processing a voter submission, you must ensure that the correct authorized absentee voter completed the B envelope.  Therefore, it is very important that the voter’s name and address on the  voter information label matches the information the voter entered on the B envelope. 

Typically, the B envelope and the voter information label will contain the same voter information…but not always. 
 
Note the example on the image.

According to the voter information label on the B envelope, Howard Fienberg is the authorized absentee voter.  A ballot was sent to Howard Fienberg.  However, it appears that the B envelope was completed by Julius Fienberg. 
 
If you encounter such a situation, CALL THE CHIEF.
