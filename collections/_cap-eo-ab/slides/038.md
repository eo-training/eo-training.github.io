After you have selected the "Check Voter In" button, a confirmation screen will appear.  Click "Confirm".  It is important to communicate verbally to your team member that check-in is confirmed.

You will be returned to the original list of voters.  A red bar now appears over the voter’s name.

What to do if you have checked in the wrong voter:  CALL THE CHIEF who will explain how to undo the check in.
