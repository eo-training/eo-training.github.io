title: "Post-Election Day Activities"

Effective July 1, 2020, a new state law requires CAP to process voter submissions that arrive at the election office by noon on the Friday after election day but are postmarked by election day.   If there is no postmark or the postmark is illegible, we refer to the date on the B envelope.  Staff will first review these envelopes and then check Ballot Scout to see if there is a pre-election date.
     1. If the oath on Envelope B was signed on or before the date of the relevant election, the ballot shall not be rendered invalid due to receipt after the close of polls. 
     2. If the oath on Envelope B was signed after the date of the relevant election, the ballot will be rejected. 
 
From Wednesday through Friday, EOs will conduct the same activities they did on election day prior to close of the poll, such as processing or handcounting ballots.  A new set of EOs will be appointed to serve for this extended processing period as necessary.
 
After noon on Friday (or after all qualified late arriving voter submissions have been processed), EOs will assist in determining final vote counts and other CAP closing activities such as packing ballots and cleaning up.
