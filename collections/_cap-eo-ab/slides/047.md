title: "ID Required Mailer"
---

Note the "ID Required" that appears on the preprinted voter information label on the B envelope. This voter has registered by mail without presenting an Identification document (ID), so must present ID before voting for the first time.

EO#1 must look for a copy of an acceptable form of ID in the mailer.  Remember, the voter may have placed it in the B envelope with the ballot.  The acceptable forms of ID are listed in the HAVA guidelines on your worktable.

If the ID is acceptable and the B envelope is complete, check the voter in on the EPB as usual.  EO#1 passes the mailer and B envelope to EO#3 to remove the ballot from the B envelope and place the ballot, folded, in the appropriate ballot box.  The ID will remain in the mailer.

If the ID is acceptable, but the B envelope contains material omissions, the voterâ€™s ballot will be rejected.  As with all rejections, check the voter in after clicking on the rejected flag.  Do not remove the ballot from the B envelope.  After completing and affixing a rejected sticker, place the mailer with all contents in the Rejected Ballot table box.
