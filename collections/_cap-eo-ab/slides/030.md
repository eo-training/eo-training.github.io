title: "Domestic B Envelope"
---

The domestic B envelope is found inside the domestic return mailer.  The voted ballot is found inside the B envelope.  

*  If there is no B envelope, this is a material omission and the ballot must be rejected.
*  If the ballot is not inside the B envelope, this is also a material omission, and the ballot must be rejected.  
*  The B envelope does not have to be sealed. 
 
The information on the B envelope is very important.  
*  EO#1 reviews the information on the B envelope to determine if any material omissions are present.
*  EO#1 reads the voter’s name from the B envelope so that EO#2 can locate that voter on the EPB.  

Note that normally a witness signature is required; that requirement may be waived during declared public health emergencies, such as the COVID pandemic.  On election day, your chief will notify you whether or not a witness signature is required.
