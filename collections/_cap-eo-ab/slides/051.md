title: "Email B Envelope"
---

The email B envelope is similar to the UOCAVA B envelope and is subject to the same set of material omissions.  Remember:  Both voter and witness signatures are required **unless** the witness signature requirement is waived due to declaration of a public health emergency.

As mentioned previously, the voter prints a copy of the email B envelope.  Notice the dotted lines that indicate "Fold Lines".   After the voter marks the ballot, the B envelope template is folded around the ballot so that the ballot is enclosed within.  Be prepared for lots of tape, glue, etc.

The ballot must be enclosed in the B envelope.  
*  Some voters cut on the dotted lines and tape the information portion onto a separate envelope, placing the ballot inside this envelope before inserting everything inside the outer mailer.  That is acceptable.
*  If a voter cuts along the dotted lines and only places the information portion into the outer mailer with the ballot, this ballot must be rejected.  The ballot was not enclosed in the B envelope.

When processing email ballots, the usual check-in procedures are followed.

However, when an email ballot is accepted, remove the ballot from the B envelope and place it in the Email Ballots table box.  Mailers and B envelopes are placed in the usual table box.

When a ballot is rejected, process as usual and place email mailer with all contents in the rejected table box.
