title: "Email Ballot Mailer"
---

A voter living overseas may request to receive a ballot and other materials by email.  The voter will print out the ballot and B envelope and return the hard copies by regular mail.

The emailed ballot file includes a template for a return mailer (see the image on right).  However, often, voters will supply their own return mailers.  Neither form of return mailer includes a preprinted voter information label.  Instead, when the ballot arrives at the Office of Elections, a staff member will write the voter’s ID # to help in the search on the EPB.
