These training materials will prepare you for any upcoming election.

However, if you are reviewing this material in advance of the June 2021 Party Primary Election, note that the county remains focused on providing a safe, supportive, and healthy work environment by continuously revising and updating and executing their Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19.  Chiefs and assistants will receive more detailed procedures during their pre-election briefing.  Election Officers will be provided any applicable current information about the Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19 before the election.

At a minimum, we will provide PPE Materials for the June 2021 Election with gloves, face masks, and hand sanitizer for election officers. If any election officer is ill before or on election day, they will be dismissed immediately.

We hope many of you have already received vaccines and those who havenâ€™t intend to do so when possible.
