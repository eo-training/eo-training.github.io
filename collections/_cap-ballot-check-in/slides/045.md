After the record comes up on your screen, you must take steps to verify you have the correct voter.  Compare the name on the VERIS-generated voter information label with the information on the voter record; do they match? Do you have the correct election? There are two choices;  1) Vienna town or 2) Democratic primary. If the correct election does not show, click on the drop down arrow on the “Election” box and click on the correct election.  Then ask yourself, was the voter sent an absentee ballot? If yes, status should show ***Issued***.  

When you have verified that the information is correct, click on the pencil icon at the lower right of the screen to edit the record.

If the voter **was not** issued an absentee ballot, the record will have a note in the absentee application section reading; ***The voter does not currently have any absentee voter applications.*** Or the ballot status will show not issued or on machine. You will not be able to edit the record.  Should you come across this situation, **contact your supervisor**.
