After applying for and receiving an absentee ballot at their home, the voter can still change their mind, not vote absentee but vote in person at a polling station or satellite voting office.

In that case, the voter will return the unopened "A" envelope to this office. Their unmarked, not voted, ballot will still be inside the sealed "A" envelope.

You may also receive unmarked ballots in the original Office of Elections mailer as undeliverable mail by the USPS.
