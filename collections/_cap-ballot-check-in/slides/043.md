title: "Checking in B Envelopes â€“ individual method"
---

Periodically, you will not be able to use the ***Batch*** method to check B envelopes into VERIS.  For example, checking in the return of a UOCAVA email ballot, a marked ballot not returned in a B envelope, or a return mailer that contains an absentee ballot that was not voted. 

Take your mouse and hover it above the ***Absentee*** tab - a drop down menu should appear.  Click on ***Absentee Search***.
