Once a return mailer is received by this office, it’s our job to accurately record receipt of all absentee ballots into the statewide voter database, known as VERIS, the Virginia Election and Registration Information System. Our goal is to NOT make any mistakes.  It’s critical that every person who has voted has their vote counted!  When recording receipt of return mailers, our focus is on accuracy, not speed. It is important that each person establish a deliberate review process that emphasizes attention to detail over swiftness.  Please remember, the completion of our task IS NOT A RACE.
