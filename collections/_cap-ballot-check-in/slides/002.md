Once a returned mailer is received by this office, it is our job to accurately record receipt of all absentee ballots in the statewide voter database, known as the Virginia Election and Registration Information System or (VERIS). Our goal in this mission is to NOT make any mistakes. It is critical that every person who has voted by mail has their vote counted! In almost every job, there is a supervisor who wants the job to be completed as quickly as possible; this is NOT one of those jobs. In this case, accuracy is paramount to success; speed is our enemy. It is critical that each person establish a deliberate review process that emphasizes accuracy over swiftness. Again, our work to accomplish this mission IS NOT A RACE.
