This election cycle will be a bit more complex than past elections as we will be managing return mailers for two separate elections simultaneously:

Vienna town election thru 7 May 2021
Democratic primary thru 11 June 2021

Ballots postmarked on or before election day are accepted until noon on the Friday after the election.
