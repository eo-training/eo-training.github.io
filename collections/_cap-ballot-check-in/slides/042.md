Now that youâ€™ve scanned and saved your batch, place a large red check mark on the center front of each scanned return mailer.  This tells anyone who sees the red check mark that the return mailer has been successfully checked in to VERIS.  Rubber band your batch mailers/B envelopes and place them in a green tray.  A green tray indicates they are ready for pre-processing by another group.
