Hopefully this course has given you a general understanding of what's involved in processing absentee ballots.

You will come to the Office Elections in the Fairfax County Government Center to get your credentials. All of the work will also be performed there.

Workloads will be highly dependent on the amount of mail received each day, so your ability to adapt to a frequently changing work environment as well as patience will greatly help you be successful.
