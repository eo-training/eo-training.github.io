Once you’ve clicked on ***All batch receipt-without IDs***, the ***Date Received*** and ***Received by Method*** boxes should appear.  ***Date Received*** defaults to the current date. The date can be changed as needed by clicking on the calendar icon to the right of the date received box.  For example, if you’re logging in mail received earlier in the week, use the calendar icon to the right of the box and click on the appropriate date. 

For ***Received by Method***, click on the arrow to the right of the box to select the appropriate method of receipt.  If scanning B envelopes in mailers delivered by USPS, FEDEX, DHL or UPS select ***Mail***.  If scanning voter drop off return mailers, select ***Mail (Non-USPS)***.  

Make sure to select the appropriate ***Received by Method*** based on whether the return mailers or B envelopes were received from USPS or from the voter drop off locations.

When the information on both lines is correct, you’re ready to begin batch scanning the return mailers.
