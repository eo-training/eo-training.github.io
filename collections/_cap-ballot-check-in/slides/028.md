If the names don't match, reinsert the "B" envelope back into the return mailer and place it in the black box by your work space. No further action by you is needed.

Some of the reasons names may not match are; husband placed his "B" envelope into the wife's return mailer or vice versa, ballot was received from a voter who is not authorized to vote absentee, roommates or voters living together in a multi-generational home put their "B" envelope in the wrong return mailers, and so on.
