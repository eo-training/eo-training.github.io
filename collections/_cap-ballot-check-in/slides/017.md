The mail is in. We now begin the meat and potatoes part of our job; sorting and counting the returned mailers, "B" envelope name verification, and voter database entry.

Two teams are tasked to accomplish this; one team to sort and count the returned mailers and a second team to work on "B" envelope verification as well as voter database entry.

Please note that assignments to either team will change periodically, as team workload is dependent on the amount of mail received each day.
