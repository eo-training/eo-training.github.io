Take one of the return mailers out of the red tray.  Compare the information on the VERIS-generated voter information label on the B envelope against the voter-provided information on the B envelope. The name and address must match.  In this case, the information matches, so reinsert the B envelope back into the mailer and return the envelope to your red tray.  If the information does not match, place the mailer in a **black tray** for further handling by another group. 

Note: periodically youâ€™ll receive a B envelope not enclosed in a return mailer.  The same voter information verification process is used.  That B envelope remains in the same tray as the other return mailers in that CD. 

Once you have verified and matched the information on the voter information label against the voter supplied B envelope info, place the mailer back in a **red tray** for entry into VERIS.
