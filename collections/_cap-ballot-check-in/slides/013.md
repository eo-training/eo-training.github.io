After the voter marks their ballot, they mail back to us their return mailer which contains a sealed "B" envelope. That "B" envelope contains their voted ballot. The back of the "B" envelope asks the voter to complete information that will verify three critical pieces of information: their identity, that they are a registered voter in Fairfax County and that they are authorized to vote absentee in the 2020 Presidential election.
