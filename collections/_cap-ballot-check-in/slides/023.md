This step is among THE most important of our tasks. It is at this point where we verify that the person who returned the absentee ballot contained in the sealed "B" envelope is the person who was authorized to receive and vote absentee for this election cycle.

This step CANNOT be rushed. Speed is our enemy here. A few extra seconds taken to verify the accuracy of the voter's information will go a long way in avoiding future processing headaches.
