In addition to returned mailers where the voter's name doesn't match the "B" envelope, there are other returned mailers that must go in the black box for further processing by another team. For example, remove returned mailers with an "ID required" notation on the return address label, mailers returned with an "A" envelope inside and all "undeliverable" mailers.

As you work, you will come across other "odd duck" returned mailers that may not fit the above circumstances but you have a question about - call your supervisor over for guidance.
