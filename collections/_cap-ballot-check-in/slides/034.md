When batch scanning, you need to focus on certain sights and sounds that should happen during the scanning process. Two critical points are listening closely for a beep each time you scan and making sure the name on the mailer appears on the screen. As you scan each returned mailer, you'll see the ballot status show as "marked" and status reason show as "ballot returned". This also is an indication of a successful scan into the VERIS database.

Once scanned, place each returned mailer you're working on in a stack next to you. By doing this, you keep separate mailers that have been scanned from those that are waiting to be entered in to the VERIS database.

After ten mailers are successfully entered, CLICK SAVE. This is a critical step.

Remember to scan NO MORE THAN 10 MAILERS per batch. The reason for that is explained in the next slide.
