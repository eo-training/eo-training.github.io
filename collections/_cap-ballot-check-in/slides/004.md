If a voter wishes to vote absentee, their first step is to submit an absentee ballot application to the Fairfax County Office of Elections. The request MUST be mailed, emailed, or submitted online through the Virginia Department of Elections online portal (an absentee ballot cannot be requested via telephone).

Once the voter's request is approved, an absentee ballot is sent to the voter within three business days.

Please note: By law, the initial mail-out of absentee ballots is required to be completed 45 days prior to an election. For the 2020 Presidential election, the initial mail-out date is 18 September. After that date, the above three business day rule to receive an absentee ballot after an application is approved applies.
