If a voter wishes to vote absentee, their first step is to submit, **in writing**, an absentee ballot application to the Fairfax County Office of Elections.  The application MUST be mailed, emailed, or submitted online through the Virginia Department of Elections online portal. An absentee ballot **cannot** be requested via telephone.

Once the voterâ€™s request is approved, an absentee ballot is sent to the requester within three business days.
