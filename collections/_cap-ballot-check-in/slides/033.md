Once you've clicked on "All batch receipt-without IDs", the above screen should appear. The window on the left should show the current date and the "received by method" will always show "mail".

If the date is not correct, use the calendar icon to the right of that line and click on the appropriate date. When the information on both lines is correct, you're ready to begin batch scanning the returned mailers.
