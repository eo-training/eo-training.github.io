There's a bit more to know about name verification requirements. As noted on the slide, the names don't have to match exactly but you HAVE to be reasonably sure the name on the "B" envelope and return mailer address label are the voter who was sent an absentee ballot and is authorized to vote in this election cycle. Allowed variations are detailed on the slide.
