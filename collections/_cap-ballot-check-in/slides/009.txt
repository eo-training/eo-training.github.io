In this image, please note the different colored stripes printed above the County of Fairfax, Office of Elections address on the front of the mailer.  These are circled in red.  The color of this stripe indicates the congressional district (CD) in which the voter resides.  CD8 is yellow, CD10 is green, CD11 is purple.  Vienna town election return mailer will have an orange stripe extending to the right of turquoise band.  The colored stripes serve as a valuable sorting tool to ensure return mailers are sorted correctly and those from the same CDs are kept together during processing operations.
