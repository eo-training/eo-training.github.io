Sorting and counting of the returned mailers is complete! All envelopes have been processed thru the Omation IM-410 which means they each have a date stamped on the front of the envelope, have been opened, counted, and that count recorded on the "returned ballot count sheet". It also means that each returned mailer has been transferred from the USPS gray mail trays in which they were delivered, to our red mail trays accurately organized by Congressional District and Herndon.

That said, we are now ready to begin step two of our process; voter/ "B" envelope verification.
