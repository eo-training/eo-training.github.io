The last returned mailer example is the email returned mailer. Military and overseas citizens can request a ballot be emailed to them, but they must print the ballot and B envelope; their completed ballot must be returned within the printed B envelope. The voter can mail their ballot back using either the Fairfax County envelope template received via email link or the ballot can be received back in a voter supplied envelope.
