After the overseas voter marks their ballot (voted), their "B" envelope will also be in the returned mailer. However the information a voter is asked to complete on the back of an overseas "B" envelope is a bit different from the domestic "B". You'll notice an address is NOT needed; only name and signature(s).

As with domestic returned mailers, the information requested on the back of the "B" helps us verify their identity, that they are a registered voter in Fairfax County and that they are authorized to vote absentee in the 2020 Presidential election.
