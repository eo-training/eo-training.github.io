Be aware that the VERIS icon can vary from computer to computer.  After you click on the icon, the VERIS sign-in page will come up.  Now log into VERIS using your VERIS username and password, **do not** use your Fairfax County log in credentials.  A message will be sent to your cell phone using the Okta Verify App.
