During scanning, VERIS periodically will show the "First Tuesday" server error. When it appears, the mailers you just scanned have NOT been saved in the database. This means you have to rescan the mailers you just scanned. The "no more than 10 rule" was set to minimize the time spent on rescanning.

You'll learn while you're working how to clear this error.
