In addition to return mailers where the voter’s name doesn’t match the B envelope, there are other return mailers that must go in the black tray for further processing by another team.  This slide details black box mailers. 

As you work, you may come across other odd duck B envelopes not listed above where you may have a question; contact your supervisor.
