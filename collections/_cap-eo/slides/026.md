In this image, please note the different colored stripes printed above the County of Fairfax, Office of Elections address on the front of the outer mailer. These are circled in red.

The color of this stripe indicates the Congressional District (CD) in which the voter resides.

These different colored stripes serve as a valuable sorting tool to ensure that ballots from the same CDs are kept together during the processing operations.
