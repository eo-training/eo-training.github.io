Once EO#2 states that the voter check-in is confirmed, EO#1 may now open the B envelope and pass the mailer and B envelope (with the ballot still inside) to EO#2.

EO#2 removes the ballot from the B envelope and places the ballot, folded, in the appropriate ballot box. EO#2 then places the mailer with the remaining contents in the "Mailers with B Envelopes" table box.
