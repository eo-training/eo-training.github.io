Vote absentee in person or by requesting a ballot to mail in.

Download a copy of the EO manual and study it.

Be on time – we need two EOs for every team to process ballots.

If you can't serve, call us immediately.

If you have any doubts or questions about a B envelope or any other task you are asked to perform, CALL the CHIEF. Better to ask questions than possibly disenfranchise a voter.

Use your reference materials – don't guess.

Bring everything you might need for the entire day or shift.
