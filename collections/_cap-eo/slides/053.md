The Recording Officer records the name of each valid write-in candidate on the Write-in Certification sheet. The Write-in Certification sheet contains all of the contests on the ballot. A valid name is written each time the Ballot Officer reads it (in the example for Governor, Joe Smith was read three times and written down three times).

Invalid names such as cartoon characters are not written down, but a tally mark is made instead in the "Invalid Candidates" box for that contest. If the Ballot Officer is not certain a write-in name is invalid, he/she can discuss the name with the Verifying and Recording Officers.
