Congratulations! You have now completed the online class for CAP Election Officers.

To receive credit for this class, you must still take and pass the quiz. You can find the quiz in the Election Officer Portal. Login, go to the Training tab, scroll down, and look in the bottom-right for a link labeled "CAP Quiz". If you do not pass the quiz the first time, you can take it again until you pass.

If you need any help, don't hesitate to call us at 703-324-7739 or email us at CentralAbsentee@fairfaxcounty.gov

Thank you for serving as an election officer!
