The domestic B envelope is found inside the domestic outer mailer. The ballot is found inside the B envelope.

* If there is no B envelope, this is a material omission and the ballot must be rejected.

* If the ballot is not inside the B envelope, this is also a material omission, and the ballot must be rejected.

* The B envelope does not have to be sealed.

The information on the B envelope is very important.

* EO#1 reviews the information on the B envelope to determine if any material omissions are present.

* EO#1 reads the voter's name from the B envelope so that EO#2 can locate that voter on the EPB.

Note that normally a witness signature is required; that requirement has been waived for the November 2020 election.
