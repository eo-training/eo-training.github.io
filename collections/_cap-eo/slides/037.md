When an EO team determines that a voter's ballot will be rejected:

EO#1 completes a rejected sticker explaining the material omission and affixes the sticker to the bottom left hand corner of the mailer. Both EOs must sign.

DO NOT REMOVE THE BALLOT FROM THE B ENVELOPE. After signing the rejected sticker, EO#2 places the mailer with all contents intact into the "Rejected Ballots" table box.

After the election, these voters will receive photocopies of their mailer and B envelope with an explanation as to why their ballot was rejected.
