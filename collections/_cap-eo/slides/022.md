Remember, a voter's Absentee Status is located in the last column on the search results page. It is important to verify a voter's absentee status.

You may only check in a voter whose absentee status indicates Issued or Marked.

If the voter's Absentee Status indicates Unused, FWAB, On Machine, or Preprocessed, CALL THE CHIEF.
