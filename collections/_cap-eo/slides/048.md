A FWAB is a Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot. It is typically used by a voter who is living in a remote location where mail service may be unreliable; for example, a submariner may submit a FWAB before leaving for an extended deployment.

When a FWAB arrives at the Office of Elections, a staff member affixes a FWAB sticker to the front of the mailer, indicating the Voter ID # and sets it aside. However, if you find one, give it to the chief.

FWABS must be processed after 7:00 PM on election day and are subject to a unique set of material omission standards. The chief will form a team to process FWABs and will review the material omissions specific to FWABs with that team.
