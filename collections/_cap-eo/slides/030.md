Let's take a moment to discuss what is acceptable in the name field on the B envelope. To demonstrate, we will use a voter named Robert Matthew Jones.

- The voter must include his full first name and full last name. For example: Robert Jones.
 However, a voter may provide only the initial of his first name if a full middle name is included. For example: R. Matthew Jones.

- The voter may include his name in an order different than "first, middle, last". For example: Jones, Robert.

- A middle name is not required, or a middle initial may be substituted. For example: Robert M. Jones.

- A voter may provide a recognized nickname. For example: Bob Jones.

- Be cautious when generational suffixes ( Jr., Sr., I, II, III) are included. Ensure that you are checking in the correct voter.
