Your precinct will be assigned at least one **PPE Specialist**. This officer will receive special training on social distancing requirements and PPE supplies (Personal Protective Equipment).

This officer will be responsible for ensuring that all social distancing signs are posted, extra tables are placed in front of each check-in table for social distancing, social distancing signs are posted on the floor, and that all election officers and party observers wear a face covering or face mask at all times when they are at their work station and/or in the voting room.

This officer will also be responsible for managing the use of PPE supplies and ensuring that items such as single-use pens and single-use privacy folders are not re-circulated or used by a second voter.

This officer will also be responsible for sanitizing voting booths, check-in tables, and all other surfaces throughout the day.
