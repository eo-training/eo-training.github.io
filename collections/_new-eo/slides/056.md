During opening procedures, it is important to open and count at least 2 packs of ballots - you want to be ready for your morning rush of voters!

The best practice is to count ballots and set them aside in groups of 10. Have two officers each count the ballots to minimize errors.

Each pack should have exactly 100 ballots. If a pack does not contain exactly 100 ballots, notify your Chief immediately.
