Let's do a quick review! Take a moment to think about these questions before you read the answer below.

What should you do with a ballot if a voter says they made a mistake? If a voter made a mistake on their ballot, you should SPOIL the ballot and issue them a new ballot.

Does an ExpressVote mark or cast ballots? An ExpressVote only marks a ballot. To be counted, the ballot must still be inserted in a DS200 scanner.

If a DS200 malfunctions or jams, what should you do? Where can voters insert their ballots? If a DS200 malfunctions, call the Chief! They are trained to handle all non-routine issues and can call technical support if needed. In the meantime, voters can insert their ballots in the DS200's Auxiliary Compartment.
