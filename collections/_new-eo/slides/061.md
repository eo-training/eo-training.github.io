title: "DS200 SCANNER: Ballots Accepted by Scanner"
layout: slide

When a voter inserts a **regularly marked ballot**, the DS200 will accept and scan it. Voters should be encouraged to wait at the machine until they hear a "clunk" sound as the ballot drops inside and the "Thank You" screen is displayed.

You will also see this screen if the voter has an **under-voted ballot**. This means the voter voted for fewer candidates or contests than they were allowed. For example, in a presidential election, some voters will only vote for president and no other contests on the ballot. Again, in this case, the DS200 will accept the ballot without issue and the "Thank You" screen is displayed.
