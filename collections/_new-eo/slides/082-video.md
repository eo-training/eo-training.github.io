After the last voter has voted, you must complete a pink Poll Pad Certification form. You will need to retrieve some numbers from each Poll Pad, beginning with the Chief’s admin Poll Pad. When this is complete, you may begin closing your Poll Pads.

To start, insert your iSync drive into each Poll Pad to export the final voter list. 

**Step 1**: On the pop-up screen touch the third option, “Export Checkins.”

**Step 2**: As during import, the pop-up will ‘flip’ and you should touch “Export Checkins” at the bottom of the pop-up.

**Step 3**: When the export is complete, remove the iSync drive and touch Done in the top right-hand corner of the pop-up.

**Repeat steps 1-3 on all Poll Pads!** After each Poll Pad is done exporting, you will need to power it off by holding down the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button simultaneously.
