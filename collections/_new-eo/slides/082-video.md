After the last voter has voted and you have completed a pink Poll Pad Certification form, you may begin closing your Poll Pads.

To start, insert your iSync drive into each Poll Pad to export the final voter list. 

**Step 1**: On the pop-up screen, touch the third option, “Export Checkins.”

**Step 2**: You will see the screen update. Do you see where it says "Ready to export"? Keep an eye on that area in a moment. Now, at the bottom of the window, tap “Export Checkins".

**Step 3**: You will see that the text has now changed to say "Completed Export." When the export is complete, remove the iSync drive. In the top-right corner, tap "Done". Finally, tap the "X" in the top-right corner.

And that's it! **Remember, you must repeat these steps on all Poll Pads!**

Lastly, you will need to power off all Poll Pads before storing them in the green case.
