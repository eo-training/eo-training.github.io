Outside the polling place, there is a 40-Foot Prohibited Area, which provides voters unimpeded access to the building.

State law does not permit loitering, congregating, or electioneering within 40 feet of a polling place entrance (i.e. the building entrance, NOT the voting room entrance). Restricted activities include campaigning, handing out flyers, and bake sales.

These activities are permitted outside of the 40-foot Prohibited Area.
