As an election officer, it is vitally important to always be professional and polite in the polling place. Always ask before assisting a voter - sometimes, they may not want assistance. Be mindful of your communication at all times.

<strong><span style="color:red;">NOTE: For the June 2021 Party Primary Election, you should also always exercise social distancing and keep 6 feet between yourself and all others in the voting room. You will also have face masks, face shields, gloves, sanitizer, and other materials as part of our Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19.</span></strong>

You should never tell a voter that they cannot vote; instead, direct them to the Chief or Assistant Chief, who can assist them and offer them a provisional ballot as needed. Do not touch voters without their permission. Avoid all political topics, especially anything that may be on the ballot, whether or not voters are present in the room.

Perception is everything, so always be aware of your words and actions. You are representing Fairfax County! If you have any questions or are unsure of what is acceptable, contact us before or on election day.
