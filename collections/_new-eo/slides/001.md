Welcome to the **New & Experienced Election Officer** online training class!

This class will go over all information you need to know before your first election. If you are a returning election officer, this class will help satisfy the state-mandated training requirement for the new two-year appointment term that began in 2021. And pay attention - there have been a lot of changes over the past year!
