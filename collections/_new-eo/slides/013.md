These are the 3 types of voting equipment used in the polling place. We will go into more detail about each type of voting equipment later in this training.

- **POLL PAD**: This is an iPad-based tablet device used to check in each voter. It is also sometimes called an electronic pollbook.

- **EXPRESSVOTE**: This is a ballot marking device. It's like a big pen! It prints a marked ballot card that voters can then scan themselves. This device is especially helpful for voters who are visually impaired or have difficulty marking a regular ballot.

- **DS200 SCANNER**: This is the device voters use to cast their ballot. It automatically scans and counts all votes.
