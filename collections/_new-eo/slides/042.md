In Fairfax County, we use **Poll Pads** as our electronic pollbooks. These are iPad-based devices used to check in voters. They synchronize with each other wirelessly over Bluetooth and do not connect to the Internet.

Itâ€™s a lot easier than having to check people in on paper, like we used to do!
