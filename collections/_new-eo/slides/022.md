There are also many IDs that you cannot accept for voting.

- A Virginia driver’s license is OK, but an out-of-state driver’s license is not.

- A US passport is OK, but a foreign passport is not.

- A photo ID from a person’s employer is OK, but IDs from other organizations—such as a credit card or Costco membership card—are not OK.

- Driver privilege cards are not accepted for voting. **IMPORTANT: On January 1, 2021, the Commonwealth of Virginia began issuing driver privilege cards to non-citizens. These look similar to driver’s licenses, but are NOT acceptable for voting purposes. The Virginia Department of Elections verifies that individuals with driver privilege cards are not in the registered voter database, so you should not encounter any issues on election day**.
