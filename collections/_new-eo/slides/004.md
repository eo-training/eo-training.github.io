If you are reviewing this material before the June 2021 Party Primary Election, note that we are continuing to prepare and execute our Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19. The plan will be similar to what we did for the June 2020 Primary Elections and November 2020 General and Special Elections, which were well-received by more than 95% of all officers according to post-election surveys.

Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs will receive more detailed procedures during their pre-election briefing the week before election day. All election officers will be provided with more information about our Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19 closer to election day.
