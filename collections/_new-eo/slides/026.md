Letâ€™s talk about the photos on various IDs.

Until June 2020, ALL IDs had to have a photo to be valid for voting purposes. This has now changed. The only IDs that are explicitly required to have a photo are an employee ID and a college/university ID, if it is from a school located outside Virginia.

IMPORTANT: Although some IDs may have a photo, you should not question the appearance of the voter (their hair may be shorter or longer, they may have changed their hair color, they may have gained or lost weight, etc.) and you must ***NEVER*** ask a voter to remove a face mask or religious face-covering to verify their identity.
