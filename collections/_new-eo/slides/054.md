Let's continue the steps to open a DS200.

- **STEP 7**: Carefully enter the election code from the password card. This code is case-sensitive and the process works best when one officer slowly reads the password from the card and another officer enters the code. A configuration report will print. Do not tear off this report yet.

- **STEP 8**: Press the green OPEN POLL button to print the Zero Totals Report, which verifies no votes have been cast on the machine. Tear off the entire tape. Two officers must sign the tape and give it to the Chief.
