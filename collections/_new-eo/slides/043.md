When you select a voter to check-in, you will also be presented with four possible "flags":

- **ASSISTED flag**: If a voter requires assistance in marking their ballot, send them to the Chief who may select this flag. The voter and their assistant must complete a "Request for Assistance" form.

- **PROVISIONAL flag**: Send provisional voters to the Chief. You will NEVER use this flag or check-in provisional voters. (This software is used by many jurisdictions and we are currently unable to disable the Poll Pad flag.)

- **OUTSIDE POLLS (OP) flag**: If the Chief asks you to check-in a "curbside voter", select this flag. A curbside voter is someone who is disabled or 65+ years of age and requests to stay in their car and vote outside the polls. (Do not question someone if they ask to vote curbside.)

- **VOTER SIGNED OATH flag**: This flag is used in two different situations.

    1. If someone is an "Inactive voter", send them to the Chief who may select this flag. Someone may become Inactive if they moved and did not update their voter registration. If they are permitted to vote, they must compete an Affirmation of Eligibility form.
    
    2. If someone does not have an acceptable ID, send them to the Chief. If the voter chooses to complete an ID Confirmation Statement, this flag must be selected.

Don't forget - the last step for checking in a voter is pressing the 'Accept' button!
