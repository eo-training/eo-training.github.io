Poll Pads arrive in your polling place in two separate cases.

- The green case holds up to 6 Poll Pads, power cables, styluses, and a printer.

- The gray bin holds the stands, driver’s license trays, extension cords, power strips, and other various parts.

Assemble the Poll Pads by inserting the swivel attachment into the base and gently attaching the ID holder to the back of the tablet. Do not press down on the top of the Poll Pad tablet; it may break off the stand if you do.

If this doesn’t make sense, don’t worry! Every precinct will have experienced election officers who are familiar with setting up the Poll Pads and other equipment that can help you.
