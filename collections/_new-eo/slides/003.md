There are some notable changes for the June 2021 Party Primary Election:

* The biggest new change this year: the Poll Pads now run updated software. It looks a bit different, but you’ll soon notice that most things are in the same place. Don’t worry, we’ll cover it all in this training!

* Last year, there were significant changes to which IDs were acceptable for voting. This year, there are some minor changes regarding student IDs and driver privilege cards.

* Remember the absentee ballot drop-off boxes at all polling places last year? Those are now a permanent part of the voting process in Virginia. Each precinct will have a drop-off box for returning voted absentee ballots.

* Finally, we will continue to observe all appropriate safety procedures, as documented in our Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19.
