Let's demonstrate how to search for voters on the new Poll Pad software.

First, the Poll Pad always begins on the home screen. Tap "Get Started" at the bottom.

If the voter offers you a driver's license, you can tap "Scan Barcode". This is how you will find most voters.

If the license will not scan or the voter simply offers you another form of ID, tap "Manual Entry" to manually search for the voter.

When doing a manual search, always search for *2 letters of the voter's last name and 1 letter of the voter's first name*. If you type more than this, it will take longer and lead to more mistakes. Leave the address fields blank unless you cannot find the voter by name only. Tap "Search".

When the list of voters is displayed, look for the name of the voter you are checking in. Be careful not to select the wrong person, such as John Smith instead of John Smith, Jr. When you've found the voter, tap on their name.

Now, you will need to advance through TWO screens, which is different than in past years.

On the first screen, you will be presented with the voter's information in large text. This is helpful to verify that you have selected the correct voter. Remember, you must repeat the voter's name out loud. For example, "I am checking in Jean Smith". Then, tap "Accept".

On the second screen, you will be presented with multiple possible check-in “flags” indluding "Assistance Required" and "Curbside". On election day, you will also have a third flag, "Voter Signed Oath". We will explain these flags shortly. But some of you may remember our old Poll Pad software had a "Provisional" flag, which we could not disable - it is now thankfully gone. Remember, we never check provisional voters in on the Poll Pad.

When you’re ready, tap the “Submit” button. You will hear a "ding" and see a confirmation screen.

Congratulations, you’ve now checked in a voter! We can see at the top of the screen that the "Checkins" count has also increased by 1.
