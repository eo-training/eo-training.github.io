**Let's go through all steps for opening a DS200**. As this is an online class, we understand it will be difficult to understand all of these steps without practicing with an actual machine. But don't worry! The Chief, Assistant Chief, and many other officers will have experience doing this before. The Chief will provide election officers assigned to open the DS200 with printed instructions, the Machine Certification Form, the keys, and a password card.

- **STEP 1**: The DS200 will be closed and secured with a green zip-tie seal. An election officer will confirm the seal number matches the Machine Certification Form. If it matches, cut the seal. Otherwise, contact the Chief.

- **STEP 2**: An election officer will unlock the Auxiliary Compartment. Look inside to verify the compartment is empty (there should be no ballots inside), then re-lock it.

- **STEP 3**: An election officer will unlock the Ballot Compartment at the bottom. Again, look inside to verify the compartment is empty, then re-lock it.
