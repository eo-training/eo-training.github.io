Remember, MOST check-ins are very simple. For the ones that aren't, just refer the voter to the Chief.

Some issues that you may encounter that you should refer to the Chief include:

If the voter's name is misspelled in the pollbook or they had a name change,

If the voter has moved or is in the wrong precinct,

If the voter has no acceptable ID,

If the voter cannot be found in the pollbook,

If the voter requested an absentee ballot but is at the polling place,

And, of course, anything related to provisional ballots.
