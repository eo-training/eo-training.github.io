**Let's go through the steps for opening a DS200**. As this is an online class, we know it will be difficult to understand all of these steps without practicing with an actual machine. But don't worry! The Chief, Assistant Chief, and many other officers will have had experience doing this before. The Chief will provide election officers assigned to open the DS200 with printed instructions, the Machine Certification Form, the keys, scissors, and a password card.

- **STEP 1**: The DS200 will be closed and secured with a green zip-tie seal. An election officer will confirm the seal number matches the Machine Certification Form. If it matches, cut the seal and give to the Chief. If it does not match, contact the Chief immediately,

- **STEP 2**: An election officer will unlock the Auxiliary Compartment. Look inside to verify the compartment is empty (there should be no ballots inside), then re-lock it. (Be sure to put the metal flap back in the ‘up’ position when re-locking the compartment, so voters don’t accidentally insert ballots here!)

- **STEP 3**: An election officer will unlock the Ballot Compartment at the bottom. Again, look inside to verify the compartment is empty, then re-lock it.
