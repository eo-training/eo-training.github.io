This is an example of the ID Confirmation statement. As you can see, itâ€™s a quick form to fill out!

By completing this short form, a voter would be allowed to vote *normally*. That means you would issue them a regular ballot, they would mark it at the polling place, and they would deposit it in a DS200 ballot scanner.
