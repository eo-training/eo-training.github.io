**We will now demonstrate the iSync import process on a Poll Pad. On election day, you will repeat this process with EACH Poll Pad.**

Once a Poll Pad has powered on and is on the home screen, insert the iSync drive into the Lightning Connector on the right side of the tablet.

**Step 1**: When the pop-up menu appears, tap "Import Voter File."

**Step 2**: You will see the screen update. Now, at the bottom of the window, tap “Import Voter File”.

**Step 3**: If you receive a message about 'airplane mode', go ahead and tap Continue.

**Step 4**: Now we wait as the import process occurs. Remember, the Poll Pad software has been updated and there are a number of minor changes. For example, you may have noticed that you no longer need to enter a password to import from the iSync drive. That's just one way things will be a little bit simpler starting with this election.

**Step 5**: When you receive the "File Transfer Complete" message, **remove the iSync drive** and then tap "OK". This process may take a few minutes.

You will notice the new iSync import process does take longer than it used to. Remember, during the import process, the iSync is transmitting records of more than 750,000 voters around the county, not just the 5,000 or so in your precinct. As you wait, remember that you can take the iSync drive and start inserting it into each of the other Poll Pads in your precinct.

Let me also take this opportunity to mention that the new Poll Pad software may appear different, but it functions very similarly to the version used in previous years. It's sort of like an app update on your phone - everything looks a little bit different and some buttons may have moved around, but after a few minutes, you'll quickly get used to it.

Now, you can see things zipping along.

**Step 6:** When the "Import Finished" window appears, tap "OK". If the Poll Pad application does not automatically restart, tap the "P" icon at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 7:** The Poll Pad application should open to the home screen. Look in the top left corner, next to where it says "Menu" - verify that the "Last imported" date has been updated. In this case, this Poll Pad is configured for a mock election on December 1, 2021 and we see that is the "Last imported" date, so we're all set!

**Remember, you must repeat all of these steps on each Poll Pad**. When you're done, give the iSync drive to the Chief.
