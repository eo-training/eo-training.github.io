**We will now demonstrate the iSync import process on a Poll Pad. On election day, you will repeat with EACH Poll Pad.**

Once the Poll Pad has powered on and is on the home screen, insert the iSync drive into the Lightning Connector on the right side of the tablet. Now you are ready to import information from the iSync.

**Step 1**: When the pop-up menu appears, tap “Import Voter File.”

**Step 2**: You will see the pop-up ‘flip’ and show “Ready to import.” Tap “Import Voter File” at the bottom of the pop-up.

**Step 3**: Once the data import is complete, touch OK and **remove the iSync** drive. The file will continue to initialize. This process may take a few minutes.

**Step 4:** Touch “OK” when the “Import Finished” pop-up appears. The Poll Pad application will restart.

**Step 5:** The Poll Pad application should open to the home screen. Verify that the current date/time displays in the screen header under the election title. 

**Repeat steps 1-5 on every Poll Pad**. Give the iSync drive to the Chief once you’re done.
