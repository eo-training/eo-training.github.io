If you cannot scan a voter's ID, you will need to search for them manually. When doing a Manual Search, always search for *2 letters of the voter's last name and 1 letter of the voter's first name*. If you type more than this, it will take longer and lead to more mistakes.

If you cannot find a voter by name, you can click to do an Advanced Search. This will allow you to look them up by other identifying information, such as their address.

When the list of voters is displayed, tap on the name of the voter who you are checking-in. Be careful not to select the wrong person, such as John Smith Jr instead of John Smith Sr.
