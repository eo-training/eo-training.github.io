We strongly encourage all officers to vote absentee, especially if you are not assigned to your home precinct (Virginia law requires you to vote in your registered precinct on election day).

The week before the election, the Chief will contact each officer to go over precinct-specific information, such as the building entrance and voting room you are using. Make sure to respond to your Chief promptly; if your Chief does not hear back from you, they may think youâ€™re no longer able to serve and ask us to replace you.

The Chief and Assistant Chief will also usually do initial setup of the voting room the day before the election or the week before the election - if possible, you should try to attend and help. You can meet your fellow officers, help arrange tables, assemble privacy booths, post indoor signs, set up the clear acrylic sneeze guards, and set up the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box. Every task you take care of before election day will make election morning a more relaxed and stress-free experience!

(Helping with pre-election setup will also give you a chance to review the route to your polling place if you are not assigned to your home precinct.)
