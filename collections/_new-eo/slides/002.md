Review all information in these slides and notes at your own pace.

We will go over all information you need to know for any election, including basic information for all election officers, which IDs you may accept from voters, how to use the Poll Pads to check-in voters, how to use the ExpressVote for voters needing help with accessibility, and how to use the DS200 ballot scanner. If there are election-specific updates, we will notify you of those by email before election day.

At the end, you must complete a quiz to receive credit for this class.
