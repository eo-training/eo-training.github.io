**POLL WATCHERS**: Authorized representatives of a party or candidate. Poll Watchers are allowed anywhere inside a polling place as long as they don't impede voters or touch voting equipment. Poll Watchers may stay and observe closing procedures, but if they do, they cannot leave the room or report results early.

**NEWS MEDIA & INTERVIEWS**: If someone wants to conduct an interview, call the Chief! They may provide basic facts (e.g. number of voters checked in), but cannot give opinions or forecasts. For anything further, call the Office of Elections.

**ELECTRONICS**: Voters ARE allowed to use personal electronic devices inside a polling place to take photos, make calls, etc. They are also allowed to take a "selfie" of themselves and/or their ballot. If they want to take a photo that includes other voters, they must ask for and receive permission from those voters first.
