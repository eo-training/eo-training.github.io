**Ensure election officers are wearing a face mask or a face shield while in the voting room.** We encourage all election officers to wear a face mask, if possible. However, if an election officer says they cannot wear a face mask (e.g. for a medical reason), they are permitted to wear a face shield. You should not question someone's reason for preferring to wear a face shield.

Election officers may choose to bring and wear their own face covering, but our office will provide enough face masks for all officers.

Help ensure election officers wear face coverings properly (always covering nose and mouth, not pulled down to talk, etc.).

We will also provide gloves that election officers can choose to wear while handling materials, such as voter IDs. Election officers are not required to wear gloves.
