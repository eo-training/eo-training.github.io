You should coordinate with your Chief and assist in setting up the voting room before election day.

Post Social Distancing signs and markings throughout the voting room. This will give all officers more time on election morning and will be a good opportunity to familiarize yourself with your polling place.

Place an extra table in front of the Check-In Tables, Ballot Table, and Chief's Table to enforce proper social distancing.

Assemble acrylic sneeze guards before election day.
