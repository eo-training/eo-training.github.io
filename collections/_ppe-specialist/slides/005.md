Thank you for agreeing to be a PPE Specialist! We really appreciate your help serving in this important role.

What are your duties as PPE Specialist?

Help prepare voting room for social distancing.

Ensure that all election officers and poll watchers wear face masks or face shields.

Sanitize voting booths and other surfaces as needed.

Ensure other officers have access to PPE materials.

NOTE: As of now, all election officers must wear a face covering. We will continue to review guidance from the CDC and the State of Virginia and will let you know before election day if there are any changes to this policy.
