What measures are we taking before election day?

- We have strongly encouraged voters to vote absentee, whether by voting early in-person, requesting a mailed absentee ballot, or using absentee ballot drop-off boxes.
- We are strongly encouraging voters at polling places to wear face coverings, including posting signs at all polling places.
- We have recruited many election officers to be able to fully staff all polling places.
- We are providing all election officer training and briefings online.
- We are directing election officers to stay home if they are ill.
- And, we are informing election officers about PPE requirements.
