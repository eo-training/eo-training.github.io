What to do if a poll watcher appears ill:

- The Chief should call Election Administration staff at 703-324-4735 and we will refer the matter to the Electoral Board and seek their guidance.
- Most importantly, ensure that the poll watcher maintains the 6-foot social distancing and encourage them to wear a face covering and gloves.
