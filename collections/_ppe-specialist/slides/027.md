- Ensure voting booths are set up at least 6 feet away from each other.
- Ensure you or an Election Officer checks the voting booth after each voter leaves to retrieve any single-use pens left in the booth by the voter. Place them in the bag with the "Used Pens" label.
- Ensure you or an Election Officer sanitizes the voting surfaces inside the voting booths on a regular basis throughout the day (approximately every 30 minutes).
