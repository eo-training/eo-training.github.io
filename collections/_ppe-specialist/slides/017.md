We will provide you with a sheet of yellow arrows to place on the floor to direct voters.

You can also use the blue painter's tape in addition to the yellow arrows (if necessary) to mark arrows on the floor to direct voters.

Direct voters into the voting room and through the voting process in a manner that will prevent them from crossing paths. Maintain 6-feet of social distancing.
