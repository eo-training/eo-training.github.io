- We will ensure that every eligible voter in Fairfax County is able to vote in a fair, efficient, and equitable manner, balancing safety measures with the right to vote.
- We will use common sense, good judgement, and the knowledge that we have gained during the past year to implement safety measures that are practical and sensible.

Let's start with the PPE Kit. Each PPE Kit contains:

- **Face Masks** – 1 box.
- **Face Shields** – 2 per precinct.
- **Gloves** – 1 box of large gloves.
- **75% Alcohol Moist Wipes** – for cleaning the Poll Pads, the ExpressVotes, the DS200 voting machines, and other surfaces.
- **Spray Disinfectant** and paper towels to clean voting surfaces throughout the day.
- **Hand Sanitizer** for election officers to use throughout the day.
- **Hand Sanitizer** for voters to use just before they leave the polling place.

In addition to the supplies in the PPE Kit, each precinct will receive materials to help enforce social distancing, including:

Each precinct will also receive 4 clear **Acrylic Sneeze Guards** to be placed at the Check-In tables, Ballot Table, Chief's Table, and other areas. Note that there is a cutout at the bottom to allow voters and officers to easily exchange materials (e.g. voter's ID, ballots, etc.).

NOTE: The sneeze guards you receive will be completely transparent after you remove the protective cover. However, in this picture, we have added blue tape to the edges of the acrylic sneeze guard so you can see it better.

Post social distancing signs and markings throughout the voting room. This will give all officers more time on election morning and will be a good opportunity to familiarize yourself with your polling place.

Place an extra table in front of the Check-In Tables, Ballot Table, and Chief's Table to enforce proper social distancing.

Assemble acrylic sneeze guards before election day.

Lastly, we will provide you with 15 Round Blue Social Distancing Signs to place on the floor in 6-foot intervals. If your voting room is in a School, School Staff will provide you with large cones. You should tape the Round Blue Social Distancing Signs to the cones and place them in 6-foot intervals. In other locations you can use blue painter's tape to **tape** the signs to the floor.

**IMPORTANT: Do not stick the round signs directly to the floor. Tape them to the cones or the floor.**

Place Round Signs and/or wide blue "painter's tape" in 6-foot intervals as follows:

- Leading to the door to the voting room
- Leading to the Check-in table
- Leading to the Voting Booth area and Voting Machine area

You can use the tape in addition (if necessary) to mark X's on the floor in 6-Foot Intervals.

layout: slide

Ensure all individuals in the polling place are adhering to social distancing markings and remaining 6-feet apart at all times, even when speaking or interacting with each other.

Ensure the number of voters in the voting room does not impede on anyone's ability to remain properly socially distanced.

section: "DURING ELECTION DAY"
title: "Slide 20"
title: "Face Coverings"
layout: slide
---

**Ensure election officers are wearing a face mask or a face shield while in the voting room.** We encourage all election officers to wear a face mask, if possible. However, if an election officer says they cannot wear a face mask (e.g. for a medical reason), they are permitted to wear a face shield. You should not question someone's reason for preferring to wear a face shield.

Election officers may choose to bring and wear their own face covering, but our office will provide enough face masks for all officers.

Help ensure election officers wear face coverings properly (always covering nose and mouth, not pulled down to talk, etc.).

We will also provide gloves that election officers can choose to wear while handling materials, such as voter IDs. Election officers are not required to wear gloves.
