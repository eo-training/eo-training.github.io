What to do if an Election Officer appears ill:

- We directed Election Officers to stay home if they are ill or if they have any symptoms, such as a cough, even if they are only suffering from seasonal allergies.

- If an Election Officer shows symptoms of illness at any time during the day, let the Chief know. The Chief will call Election Administration staff at 703-324-4735, then ask the Election Officer to leave.
