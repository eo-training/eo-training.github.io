The Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19 currently includes the following measures at minimum:

1. Provide each polling place with face masks, face shields, gloves, disinfecting wipes, and hand sanitizer for election officers. (You may bring and wear your own face mask.)

2. Provide each polling place with 8 clear acrylic “sneeze guards” to place at each check-in table and other areas.

3. Require all election officers to wear a face mask or face shield at all times in the voting area.

4. Limit the number of voters in the voting room.

5. Require voters to maintain a 6-foot distance from each other and from election officers.

6. Provide all training online.

7. If any election officer is ill before election day, we will replace them immediately.

8. If any election officer appears ill on election day, we will send them home immediately.
