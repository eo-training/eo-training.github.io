title: "ABSENTEE VOTING: Absentee Ballot Return Deadline"
---

Hand-in-hand with a change to when you can REQUEST a mailed absentee ballot, there’s also been a change for how long you have to return it.

Previously, mailed absentee ballots had to have arrived in our office by 7:00 PM on election day, the same time polls close in all precincts.

Now, however, a voter can postmark their ballot on election day. As long as we receive it in our office by 12:00 PM on the Friday after the election, it will be counted.

It’s important to know this in case a voter comes to your precinct on election day with their absentee ballot in hand. Direct them to the Chief, Assistant Chief, or Non-Routine Specialist, who can advise them of all their options, which now includes mailing it back on election day.
