The General Assembly also made a small change to when you may request a mailed absentee ballot. Previously, you had to request your ballot up to 7 days before the election, usually a Tuesday. Now, the deadline is 11 days before the election, which would usually be a Friday.

If you are assigned to serve as an election officer, we strongly encourage you to vote absentee in-person or absentee by mail. While we’ll try our best, there’s no guarantee that we can assign you to your own voting precinct. So if you don’t vote absentee, you won’t be able to leave your polling place and vote on election day.
