Who are the people in the polling place?

- **CHIEF AND ASSISTANT CHIEF**: Work together as a team to manage the polling place. They assign and rotate election officers throughout the day. Most importantly, they are trained to handle all non-routine voter situations.

- **ELECTION OFFICERS**: Throughout the day, regular election officers greet voters, check-in voters, issue ballots, and direct voters to mark & cast ballots. Some precincts may have Language Officers, who perform all regular officer duties and may also assist voters who speak a different language, such as Spanish, Vietnamese, or Korean. (All Language Officers have been assessed for their language skills.)

- **HIGH SCHOOL PAGES**: Only serve in November elections. They may help in many ways, but they are <span style=text-decoration: underline">not registered voters and may not operate or supervise use of voting equipment.</span> However, the Code of Virginia does allow Pages to help setup voting equipment before polls open and count unmarked ballots.
