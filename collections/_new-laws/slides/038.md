Weâ€™re almost at the end! A few more updates:

- Election officers cannot be subjected to adverse personnel or employment actions for serving on election day, so long as you gave your employer reasonable notice.

- Also, the Code of Virginia now says that all election officers must be trained anytime there is a change to procedures or equipment. In Fairfax County, we also begin our new appointment term in 2021, so all officers will have to be re-trained at that time before they can serve again. But once you complete that training, you will be set for the 2-year term, barring any changes to procedures or equipment.
