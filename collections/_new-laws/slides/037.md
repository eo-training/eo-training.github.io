A few miscellaneous updates:

- Sample ballots may now be printed on yellow paper, which was previously banned.

- You may have heard that Election Day is now a state holiday. This means it is a holiday for people who work for the state government. It is still up to individual employers to decide whether to give this day off to all their employees or not.

- Just to confirm, polls are open from 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM this election. This is the same as it has always been.
