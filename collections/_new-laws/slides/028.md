For voters without an acceptable ID, they can now complete an ID Confirmation Statement which allows them to vote normally on election day. However, how should you record this information on the Poll Pad?

First, the voter completes the form and the Chief should request that you check-in the voter.

Next, it’s very simple: select the “Voter Signed Oath” flag.

(Note: This is the same flag used for Inactive voters. However, there is no change in procedure for Inactive voters. To be eligible to vote, they will continue to use the Affirmation of Eligibility form before being permitted to vote normally.)
