In the past, when you interacted with the DMV (e.g. getting a new or updated driver’s license), you had the option of asking for your information to be forwarded to the Department of Elections to update your voter record.

This process has now changed from an “opt-in” method to an “opt-out” method. That means any changes you make with the DMV will be automatically sent to the elections office so we may update your voter record.

This may cause a change in a voter’s precinct. This may affect some voters who show up to the “old” precinct on election day, not realizing their voter registration information has been automatically updated.
