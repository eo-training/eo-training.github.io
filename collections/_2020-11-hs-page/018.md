These are some of the signs that will be posted inside the polling place. They include directional arrows; voting instructions on how to mark the ballot; sample ballots; a map of the 243 precincts in Fairfax County; and a poster that will explain the referendum on the ballot. This year there will be two Virginia constitutional amendments and four County bond questions on the ballot. A bond is like asking the voters if they want to take out a loan to finance projects like building schools, or renovating libraries, or maybe improving park facilities.
