Afternoon pages, along with your election team, will basically break down everything that was put up in the morning. This includes taking down the signs and carefully removing the tape; restoring and cleaning up the voting room; helping pack up all of the voting equipment; organizing and packing up the election materials and supplies, including the personal protective equipment. Some of the supplies will be placed back into the machine cart which will be picked up by county personnel within a few days after the election.

You will help load the items that need to be returned to the Government Center in the Chief's car. Now you afternoon pages can head home to get some rest!
