Because you will have taken this training and will also take on oath on Election Day, you are considered part of the official election team. As such, you will follow the same code of conduct as the election officers. You will treat voters with respect including seniors and those with disabilities. This is not a partisan activity so everything you do must be impartial and nonpolitical. You will not engage in discussions about candidates or other political issues.
