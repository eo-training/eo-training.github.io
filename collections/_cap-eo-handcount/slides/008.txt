title: "Communications Oath"
---

State law allows the chief to begin the handcount process prior to the close of poll.  Because you will be seeing votes on mailed-in ballots prior to the poll closing at 7 p.m., all personnel present in CAP are required to take a communications oath.  

You swear to not reveal any voting information you might see to outside parties until the poll closes.  You will also be required to turn your cell phone off or to airplane mode.
