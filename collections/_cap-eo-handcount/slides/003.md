Most mailed-in ballots are scanned by digital scanning machines.  If a ballot cannot be scanned, however, the votes on it still must be counted.  These ballots are typically damaged ballots and ballots that were emailed to UOCAVA voters.

A non-scannable ballot will have two types of information â€“ votes for candidates/issues and votes for candidates the voter wrote in on the ballot.  CAP must record both types of information.

The chief will assign EOs to handcount teams, typically 3 to 6 people on a team depending on the number of contests on the ballot.  The chief will review the handcounting procedures with the teams.
