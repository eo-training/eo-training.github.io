Ballots are counted batch by batch.  

The number of ballots in a batch is announced and recorded on the first tally sheet.

Every ballot in a batch is read by the ballot officer and appropriate votes are recorded on tally sheets or write-in certifications.

The process is repeated until all batches of ballots have been completed.

Votes cannot be totaled until after polls have closed.
