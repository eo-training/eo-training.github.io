title: "Tallying Votes"
---

Votes are recorded by placing tally marks on the tally sheet for each vote read by the ballot official.  Tally marks are entered in groups of five.

Make sure you put the tally mark in the box for the correct contest and candidate (or "Yes" or "No" for votes on issues).

Votes for write-in candidates must be recorded for the correct contest, but NAMES of write-in candidates will be entered on the write-in certification sheet for that contest.

Overvotes occur when a voter has chosen more names than allowed.  No candidate for that contest gets a vote and a tally mark is entered in the Overvote row.
