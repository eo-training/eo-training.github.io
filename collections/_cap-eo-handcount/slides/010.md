Tally sheets are used to record the number of ballots counted and the total number of votes for each candidate.

Tally sheets are specific to individual sets of ballots.  In this example, the tally sheet is only used for ballots from CD 8.

Tally sheets include all contests and issues on the ballot.

Tally sheet sets are typically multiple pages in order to include all contests and issues.  Long ballots with many contests may require two or more recording officers.
