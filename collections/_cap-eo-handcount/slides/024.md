You must take both training modules: CAP Absentee EO and Handcount.

Take the EO training quiz in Poll Chief after you have completed both modules.

Vote early in person or by requesting an absentee ballot to mail in.

Download a copy of the EO manual and study it.  You may bring the manual with you on election day.

Be on time – we need full teams to process ballots.

If you can’t serve, call us immediately.

Use your reference materials – don’t guess.

If you have any doubts or questions about any task you are asked to perform, CALL the CHIEF.  Better to ask questions than possibly disenfranchise a voter.

As an EO, you will be at CAP for many hours.  Bring everything you might need for the entire day or shift.
