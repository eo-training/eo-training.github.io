title: "Totaling the Votes"
---

Votes are totaled (tally marks are counted) for each set of tally sheets after any time 7 p.m. on election day.  The final totals of votes from all tally sheets are completed after noon on Friday when CAP closes.

Total number of ballots cast is determined by adding the individual ballot batch counts on the first tally sheet when the votes are totaled on that sheet.

Tally marks are added across the page for each candidate.  The total number of tally marks is entered in the column on the right side of the tally sheet.
