During the day, unscannable ballots will be identified and set aside.   (For CAP EV, unscannable ballots from satellite Early Voting locations will be delivered to the CAP EV chief at the beginning of election day.)

The CAP AB chief will periodically have those ballots unfolded, sorted by CD, counted and placed in batches.

During the day, the chief will assign EOs to handcount teams.  The chief will brief EOs on their duties.

Before handcounting begins, the chief will gather everyone together to take the communications oath.

Once handcounting begins, sorted batches of ballots will be taken to the handcount teams.
