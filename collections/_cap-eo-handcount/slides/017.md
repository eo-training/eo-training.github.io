The handcount team acts like a voting machine, which means you must perform the same two critical tasks – recording the number of ballots cast and the votes on each ballot.

The first critical task is to count the number of ballots in each batch.

The ballot officer does the initial count and the verifying officer confirms the count.  The ballot officer also verifies that all ballots in the batch are the same CD as the tally sheet by checking the ballot style on the lower left corner of the ballot.

The ballot officer announces the count.

The EO recording officer who has the first page of the tally sheets enters the number in the next available space in the “Ballot Count per Batch” section at the top of the tally sheet.  In the example, this is the third batch of ballots the team is processing, so the number is entered on the next open slot.

The batch count is recorded ONLY on the first tally sheet page.
