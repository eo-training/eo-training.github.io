When you arrive at the Government Center, your location and team number are on your badge. Find your team quickly. The chief will administer the election oath to all EOs; you must sign the election oath as well as the compensation sheet.

The chief will brief all EOs on conducting the CAP operation and will provide a review of ballot processing procedures.

The poll will open at 6 a.m., so it is important that you arrive on time.
