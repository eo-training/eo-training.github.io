Sometimes a voter's original packet is returned unopened either by the voter or by the post office. It typically contains all the papers that were sent to the voter, including the instructions.

The office of elections staff usually finds these and sets them aside. This voter is NOT checked in.

If you do come across an unused packet, give it to the chief.
