What is an acceptable address on the B envelope?

- An address must include the voter's house or building number and the street name. An apartment or unit number is NOT required.

- A voter must provide the city OR the zip code.

- A voter may NOT provide a Post Office Box (POB) or Personal Mail Box (PMB) on the B envelope.

More things to remember:

If a voter has provided an address on the B envelope that is different than his registered address in the EPB, CALL THE CHIEF.

In a few instances, you will find a POB or PMB for a voter on the electronic poll book. CALL THE CHIEF. You have encountered a protected voter. The chief will provide further instructions.
