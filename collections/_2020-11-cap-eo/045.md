A voter living overseas may request that a ballot file be emailed to him. The voter will print out the ballot and B envelope and return the hard copies by regular mail.

The emailed ballot file does include a template for an outer mailer (see the image on right). However, often, the voter will supply his own outer mailer. Neither form of outer mailer includes a preprinted return address label. Instead, when the ballot arrives at the Office of Elections, a staff member will write the voter's ID # to help in the search on the EPB.
