You will find two valuable reference guides at your workstation.

- The Material Omissions Chart is a comprehensive, user-friendly table outlining acceptable/unacceptable standards for the review of B envelopes. As an election officer, you will be expected to make important decisions regarding the acceptance or rejection of a voter's ballot based on the information provided by the voter on his B envelope. These decisions must be made fairly and consistently. If there is any question about the information on a voter's B envelope, the answer can usually be found in the Material Omissions Chart.

However, if you are ever in doubt, CALL THE CHIEF.

2. The HAVA (Help America Vote Act) Guidelines is used when reviewing submissions from voters who must provide a copy of an acceptable form of identification with their ballot. Refer to these guidelines to determine if the voter has submitted an acceptable form of ID.
