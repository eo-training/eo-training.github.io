Effective July 1, 2020, a new state law requires CAP to process all mailed-in absentee ballots that arrive at the election office by noon on the Friday after election day. Absentee ballot must be postmarked by election day, but ballots with missing or illegible postmarks will also be accepted.

From Wednesday through Friday, EOs will conduct the same activities they did on election day prior to close of the poll, such as processing or handcounting ballots. A new set of EOs will be appointed to serve for this extended processing period as necessary.

After noon on Friday (or after all ballots received have been processed), EOs will assist in determining final vote counts and other CAP closing activities such as packing ballots and cleaning up.
