This is an example of a Voter Detail Page. After you have searched for and located the correct voter in the EPB and clicked on that voter's name, the voter's Detail Page will appear.

Locate the green "Check Voter In" button in the bottom left-hand corner. When a voter has submitted a complete and correct B envelope, you will select the "Check Voter In" button.

Locate the "Rejected" flag in the upper right-hand corner. If a voter's B envelope is incomplete or incorrect (i.e. contains material omissions), you must first click on the rejected flag, then select the "Check Voter In" button.

This will be explained in greater detail later in the training.
