Elizabeth Marie Ambrose's detail page appears. Is this the correct voter? We must be sure soâ€¦

EO#1 reads the full name and address from the voter's B envelope to verify that the correct voter has been selected.

* If this is the correct voter, select the "Check Voter In" button.

* If this is not the correct voter, select "Back to List" button on the lower right-hand corner of the page. This brings you back to the original list of voters. Find the correct voter on the list.
