Most mailed-in ballots are scanned by digital scanning machines. If a ballot cannot be scanned, however, the votes on it still must be counted. These ballots are typically email and damaged ballots.

A non-scannable ballot will have two types of information â€“ votes for candidates/issues and votes for candidates the voter wrote in on the ballot. CAP has to record both types of information.

The chief will assign EOs to handcount teams, typically 3 to 6 people on a team depending on the number of contests on the ballot. The chief will review the procedures with the teams.
