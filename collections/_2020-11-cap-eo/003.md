These training materials will prepare you for any upcoming election.

However, if you are reviewing this material in advance of the November 2020 General Election, note that the county is continuing to prepare and execute their Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19. Chiefs and assistants will receive more detailed procedures during their pre-election briefing. Election Officers will also be provided with current information about our Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19 before the election.

At minimum, we will provide PPE Materials for the November 2020 Election with gloves, face masks, and hand sanitizer for election officers. If any election officer is ill before or on election day, they will be dismissed immediately.
