The image shows a UOCAVA mailer. UOCAVA stands for Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. The UOCAVA mailer will contain a special UOCAVA B envelope with a standard digital ballot inside.

A UOCAVA submission is sent to the Office of Elections by an authorized absentee voter who is living overseas or by military personnel living anywhere.

The mailer is similar to the domestic mailer. It comes from the Office of Elections and contains a preprinted return address label on the reverse side. The only difference is that the acronym "UOCAVA" appears on the front of the mailer in a white box (inside the blue portion of the mailer).
