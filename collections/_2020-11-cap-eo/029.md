Once EO#1 is sure that the correct authorized voter has completed the B envelope (i.e. mailing label and B envelope information agree), he must review the B envelope for material omissions.

- The B envelope must be completed correctly and completely. It must contain:

    - Voter's name

    - Voter's address

    - Voter's signature

    - Witness signature

- A date is NOT required.

If there are no material omissions, EO#2 can find this voter in the EPB. Once again, it is important to verify the identity of the voter. The information on the B envelope must also match the information on the EPB.

If there are any discrepancies, CALL THE CHIEF.
