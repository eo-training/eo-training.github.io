An email voter must complete the same Statement of Absentee Voter as other UOCAVA voters and is subject to the same set of material omissions. No address is required. No date is required. The voter does not even have to provide a printed name.

However, the signatures of the voter and a witness are required. If either of the two signatures is missing, the mailer cannot be checked in. Place the mailer in the "Needs Cure" table box.

The statement of voter may be taped to the back of the return mailer or enclosed in the return mailer. Its location doesn't matter, as long as it accompanies the ballot.

Be prepared for many different sizes of printed email ballots - all are valid.
