**Hours of service:** The schedule of operations is based on the volume of mailed-in and drop box voter submissions. The projected start date is Friday, October 1st but this date may change as the election nears. Staff will be advised of the overall schedule as soon as the Office of Elections understands the anticipated volume of ballots.

Keep in mind that scheduling and assignment flexibility is key! You may or may not be assigned on any given day. We ask you to remain happily flexible! You know the routine...it all depends on the mail!
