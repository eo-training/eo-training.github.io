The left side of this slide shows the items that need to be edited and verified. We must ensure VERIS reflects the correct information for the voter.

- Confirm the Ballot Received Date is the same as the date indicated on the tray label. If not, adjust the date by clicking on the calendar icon.

- The Received by Method field defaults to "Mail" which means the return mailer was delivered by the post office or a commercial mail delivery service (UPS, FEDEX, DHL). If the return mailer was received from a voter drop off location, Received by Method should be changed to "Drop Off".

- Change the Status from "Issued" to "Pre-Processed".

- Add the bundle number into the Ballot Status Comment field.

- Click save. VERIS will then return you to the voter's overview page which will reflect the changed voter status.
