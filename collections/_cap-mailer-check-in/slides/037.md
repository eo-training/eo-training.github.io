You are now ready to "put the scanner to the mailer".

Step 1. Ensure that you have accessed the correct VERIS screen; you will see the Received Date and the Received By Method fields on the screen.

Step 2. The team leader provides a red or gray tray containing unopened digital domestic and/or UOCAVA return mailers, all with scannable barcodes. All the mailers in the tray have been received on the same date and by the same method. Look for the bundle number on the front of the tray. Change the Received Date and Received by Method on the VERIS screen, if necessary, to correlate with the bundle number and color of tray.

Step 3. Immediately transfer the bundle number label to the front of a green tray. This step is very important. The checked-in mailers from the original tray must all stay together in one green tray with the same bundle number.

Step 4. Count out a set of 50 mailers, then quickly "eyeball" each mailer in the set and remove any email ballots (because these do not have scannable bar codes) and any Unused mailers. Give these to the Team Leader.
