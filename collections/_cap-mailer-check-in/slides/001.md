Welcome to the Fairfax County Office of Elections Central Absentee Precinct's online training class for Mailer Check-In.

Beginning with the November 2021 election, Mailer Check-In will replace what was formerly known as "preprocessing". Experienced preprocessors will note a number of important operational changes.

This course is designed to provide both new and returning staff with the knowledge required to successfully participate in the Mailer Check-in operation.

Please take some time to review this online training. As always, we welcome your questions and comments; we hope you will share any insights you may have as you participate in this class.
