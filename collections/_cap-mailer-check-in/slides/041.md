Step 9. Continue scanning. The list of voters on the screen will grow longer each time a new mailer is scanned. Each time you scan, listen closely for a "beep". Verify that the name on the mailer is the same name that appears on the VERIS screen, that the ballot _Status_ is "Marked", and that the _Status Reason_ is "Ballot Returned".

Once scanned, place each mailer, facedown, in the separated pile.

VERIS is programmed to allow 10 mailers to be batch scanned at one time. After you have successfully scanned 10 mailers, take one more look at the VERIS screen to reconfirm:

- The count in the upper right corner shows 10
- _Status_ shows "Marked" for all voters
- _Status Reason_ shows "Ballot Returned" for all voters.

Step 10. **Click Save**. This is a critical step! Place the 10 successfully scanned mailers in the "Saved in VERIS" table box.

Step 11. Continue this same process to scan the remaining mailers in your set. When scanning is complete, the "Saved in VERIS" table box will contain approximately 50 unopened mailers, still containing ballots; the status of each of these ballots has been updated to "Marked".

**Problems?**

**Immediately notify the team leader if any mailer will not scan or an error message pops up on the computer.**
