The voter information label and Statement of Absentee Voter is printed on the reverse side of the return mailer. This has eliminated the need for a separate B Envelope.

The information on the reverse side of the return mailer is very important:

- Note the voter information label circled in red. This label contains identifying information about the authorized absentee voter, including the voter's name, address, voter ID #, and unique scannable barcode. The label also specifies the current election as well as the voter's congressional district (CD) and precinct. The label will include the letters "NA" if a Request for Assistance form must be submitted by the voter. The label will indicate "ID Required" if an acceptable form of ID must be submitted (usually by a first-time voter who has registered by mail), per Help America Vote Act (HAVA) guidelines.

- This same voter must complete the Statement of Absentee Voter located beneath the label.

- Check-in staff will review the information both on the voter information label and the Statement of Absentee Voter to determine if the correct authorized absentee voter has mailed in the ballot and if any material omissions are present.
