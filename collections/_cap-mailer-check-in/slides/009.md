Safeguarding voter and ballot information is the responsibility of everyone on the mailer check-in staff. You may not communicate any information you see or hear to any unauthorized person while mailer check-in operations are in session as well as when you leave the work area.

That includes:

- Not posting on any social media.
- Not using your cell phone at the workstations (except to access VERIS), and especially while handling any voter or ballot information.
- Not taking photos while in processing.
- Not connecting to the Internet while in a CAP workrooms.
