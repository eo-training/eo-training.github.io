For returning preprocessors, you will find a number of changes to operations for the upcoming election.

- In the past, preprocessing was always conducted by teams of two staff members: A Ballot Officer and a VERIS Officer. This is no longer required. One staff member will now carry out both functions.

- The typical voter submission, an outer mailer containing a B envelope containing a ballot, is history! There is a new return mailer, and it does double duty. The front side of the return mailer contains the Office of Elections address. The reverse side of the return mailer contains the voter information label AND the _Statement of Absentee Voter (_or voter statement_)_, eliminating the need for a separate B envelope.

- Mailer check-in now includes an added step in VERIS. You will be required to update a voter's ballot status in VERIS to "Marked" before updating the status to "Pre-Processed". Previously, this function was handled by the Mail Intake Team.

- Mailer check-in staff no longer removes ballots from mailers. This function will be completed at a different time by different staff members.

These changes have been instituted so that the entire CAP operation can function more efficiently. However, there is NO change to what is expected of processors: a compliance with operational procedures, an attention to detail, and a focus on accuracy.
