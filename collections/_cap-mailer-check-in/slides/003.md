In advance of the November 2, 2021 Elections, it is important that you are aware of the county's Contingency Response Plan for COVID-19.

Fairfax County remains focused on providing a safe, supportive, and healthy work environment and is continuously revising and updating its COVID-19 guidelines. The Office of Elections will ensure that applicable information regarding any changes is passed on to staff before operations begin. We are currently waiting for final directives from the county regarding the COVID-19 vaccination and testing mandates.

The county continues to require that all staff be masked. A face shield may be worn over a mask but may not be worn in place of a mask.

The Office of Elections will supply gloves, face masks, and hand sanitizer as well as surface cleaning supplies.

Of course, in order to protect the health of others, if you are ill, please stay home. If you become ill while on the job, you will be sent home.
