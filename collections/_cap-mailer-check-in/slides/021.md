What is an acceptable address on the voter statement?

- An address must include the voter's house/building number and the street name. An apartment or unit number is not required.
- A voter must provide the city OR the zip code.
- A voter _may not_ provide a Post Office Box (POB) or a Personal Mail Box (PMB) on _the Statement of Absentee Voter_.

If a voter has provided an address on the voter statement that is different from the address on the voter information label, place the mailer in the "Not Processed" table box. Likewise, if a voter has provided a Post Office Box (POB) or a Personal Mailbox (PMB), place the mailer in the "Not Processed" table box.
