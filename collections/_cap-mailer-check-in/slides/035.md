Once you've clicked on "All batch receipt-without IDs", the Date Received and Received by Method fields should appear. Date Received defaults to the current date. The date may need to be changed to the date the mailer was received at the Elections Office. The date can be changed by clicking on the calendar icon to the right of the date received box. For example, if you're checking in mail received earlier in the week, use the calendar icon to the right of the box and click on the appropriate date.

For the Received by Method, click on the arrow to the right of the box to select the appropriate method of receipt. If scanning mailers delivered by USPS, FEDEX, DHL or UPS select "Mail". If scanning drop box return mailers, select "Drop-off".

Make sure to select the appropriate Received by Method based on whether the return mailers were received by mail or from voter drop box locations. If you are unsure, check with the team leader.
