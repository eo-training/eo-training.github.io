It is very important that the "Date Received" and "Received by Method" are entered correctly in VERIS.

Members of our ingenious Mail Receipt team have created an organized system to help us maintain accuracy. This entails using different colored trays based on method of receipt and labeling each tray with a specific designator that includes the received date.

Note the colors of the trays. A red tray contains mailers with digital ballots, both domestic and UOCAVA, that arrived by mail. A gray tray holds mailers with digital ballots that were returned by drop box. A blue tray contains mailers from voters who requested email ballots.

Note the label attached to the front of each tray. The label indicates the bundle number. The bundle number always starts with the received by date and includes the tray number.

These bundle numbers help track the ballots through the workflow of receipt, check-in, and pre-processing (ballot extraction and scanning).
