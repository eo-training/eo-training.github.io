Step 17. Your last task is to complete the Mailer Count worksheet to account for both the processed and not processed mailers in Set 1.

- Record the number of mailers that were originally taken from the red tray, (probably 50) in the _Total Mailers at Start_ column for Set 1.

- When you were evaluating the voter statement for material omissions, did you place any mailers in the "Not Processed" table box? Record this number in the _Not Processed Mailers_ column for Set 1.

- Count the number of processed mailers. Record this number in the _Processed Mailers_ column for Set 1.

The number of processed mailers + the number of not processed mailers = the number of mailers at start.

When these numbers reconcile, wrap the Not Processed mailers in a sheet of paper. Write the Bundle # and the Set # on the paper. Leave the wrapped Not Processed mailers in the "Not Processed" table box.
