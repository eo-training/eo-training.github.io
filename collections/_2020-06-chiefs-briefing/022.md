Each polling place will receive 3 to 6 Poll Pads but you can only set up 2 Poll Pads for check-in and 1 for the Chief. Each polling place will also receive one DS200 scanner and one ExpressVote machine. Please note that there are two ExpressVote machines in your gray cart but only one is set up for the election. Please use the ExpressVote with the piece of yellow tape on it. If your DS200 scanner does function properly, please call Technical Support staff at 703-324-4101 and use the auxiliary compartment. Each polling place will receive 6 to 8 Election Officers.

*(NOTE: This slide previously said the ExpressVote would be marked with blue tape. It will actually be marked with yellow tape. If the tape has fallen off in transport, it will be the ExpressVote closer to the middle of the cart.)*
