During this online Briefing, we will do our best to provide you with the same type of detailed information that we usually provide during in-person Briefings. We will also provide you with information on our Contingency Response Plan for Polling Place Operations During COVID-19. In addition, you will have an opportunity to participate in a question and answer session at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, June 19.
