title: "ELECTION MORNING AND DURING THE DAY: Turnout surveys"
---

As always, we are conducting turnout surveys on election day at 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 3:00 PM. These help us gauge turnout throughout the day and send you more ballots, if needed.

At each designated time, we will send you a text message with an online link. You may also call us instead.

We strongly encourage you to pull out this page from your Chiefs Notebook and hand it to one of your election officers, as anyone may submit these numbers. It may be helpful to set alarms on their phone, so they don&#39;t forget!
