Welcome! It will take approximately **1 hour** to review the online briefing for Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs. You can pause anytime.

Note that audio narration plays automatically for each slide. At the end of each narration, you will advance to the next slide automatically. (If you pause the audio, the slide will not advance.)
