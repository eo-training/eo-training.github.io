title: "OVERVIEW: Mark X's on the floor"
---

Use blue &quot;painter&#39;s tape&quot; to mark X&#39;s on the floor in 6-foot intervals leading to the door to the voting room, leading to the check-in table, leading to the voting booth area, and leading to the voting machine area to maintain social distancing. It is very important that you remove all blue tape from the floor just after the polls close and throw it in the trash.
