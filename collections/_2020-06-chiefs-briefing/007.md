title: "OVERVIEW: Reminders from the Contingency Response Plan"
---

The following are important reminders from the Contingency Response Plan. Voters can enter the polling place and vote even if they are not wearing a face covering. You must maintain 6-feet of social distancing between everyone in the polling place. Face Coverings must be worn by Election Officers at their station, even if no voters are present. We are providing face shields for further protection. We are providing an extra Election Officer to help with social distancing and sanitizing. Use spray disinfectant to frequently sanitize voting surfaces and other areas that are touched. Use sterile alcohol prep pads to clean Poll Pad and ExpressVote screens. Election Officers are to be given frequent breaks. We are providing hand sanitizer for Election Officers to use throughout the day and for voters to use only as they exit the polling place.
