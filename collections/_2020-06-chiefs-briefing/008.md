---

Most of the precincts in the 8th and 10th Congressional District will have 6 Election Officers and most of the precincts in the 11th Congressional District will have 7 Election Officers. A few precincts will have an extra Election Officer because their polling place moved or there is some other special circumstance. The Greeter will help with social distancing. The Pollbook/Ballot Officers will check-in voters and issue ballots. They will also offer ever voter a single-use privacy folder and give every voter a single-use pen. The Booth Monitor will monitor voting booths and clean voting surfaces. They will also remove any pens that are left in the voting booths by voters. The Voting Machine Officer will monitor the voting machine and assist voters as needed. Even when assisting voters, they should maintain the 6-feet of social distancing. The Assistant Chief will need to serve in one of these positions. You will only send one Election Officer outside for curbside voters. You should send either one of the Pollbook/Ballot Officers or the Voting Machine Officer. If you send the Voting Machine Officer, you should ask the Booth Monitor to also monitor the voting machine.
