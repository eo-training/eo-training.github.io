Step 3: Remove all the ballots. Check the sides and inside door.

Step 4: Stack the ballots in a neat pile.

Step 5: Place ballots in the cardboard boxes. You may reuse the empty boxes that the new ballots came in plus you have 3 additional boxes in the grey cart. You should be able to get at least 800 ballots in one box so if you know that you have more than that you can prepare as many boxes beforehand.
