All Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs will receive a Chiefs Notebook and election supply envelope at your Supply Pickup time.

Usually, the Chief in each precinct receives a black rolling kit. This election, the Chief will also receive a PPE Kit when you come to your Supply Pickup time.

If you are the Chief, please make sure you have enough space in your car to take all of these materials with you.
