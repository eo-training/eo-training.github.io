Please review the position description for the Pollbook/Ballot Officer. You should remove this position description from the back of your Notebook and give it to the Election Officer who will serve in this position. Please note that we have combined the Pollbook Officer and Ballot Officer positions for this election because we will not be using voter permit cards, we expect a low turnout, and we need to do anything we can to maximize social distancing.
