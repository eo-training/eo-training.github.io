title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS: Voter Referral Worksheet"
---

When your election officers have a voter they cannot check in on the Poll Pad and need to refer them to the Chief, have them fill out a Voter Referral Worksheet with the &quot;reason for the referral&quot; box checked off. This worksheet will help you understand the issue you need to resolve and also where you can find it in the &quot;What If&quot; section of your Chiefs Notebook.
