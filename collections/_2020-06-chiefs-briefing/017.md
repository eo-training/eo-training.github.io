Offer all voters a single-use privacy folder. Only place the ballot in a single-use privacy folder if the voter indicates that they would like a privacy folder. Place the ballot inside the single-use privacy folder if the voter asked for one, then place the ballot inside the box lid. Place a single-use pen on top of the ballot in the box lid. Please remember that single-use pens and privacy folders will not be re-used on Election Day. Place single-use pens that are left by voters in the &quot;Used Pens&quot; bag. Place single-use privacy folders that are left by voters in a trash bag along with used face coverings and used gloves.
