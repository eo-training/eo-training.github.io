title: "CLOSING THE POLLS: Remove all media"
---

Once you have closed down and unplugged both the DS200 and the ExpressVote machines, you will need to remove the media sticks, also known as USB flash drives, and return them in the orange #7 pouch. For this election, you will have only one DS200 machine and one ExpressVote Machine which means that you will have 3 media sticks to return.

From the DS200, you will have 1 backup media stick labeled with a yellow dot and 1 media stick with an orange dot. And from the ExpressVote machine you will have a media stick with a green dot. You will have 3 media sticks in total.
