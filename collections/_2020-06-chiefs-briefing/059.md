title: "ELECTION MORNING AND DURING THE DAY: Silver bar on DS200"
---

When you or your election officers are setting up your DS200 scanner, remember to check the silver bar in the back compartment.

This silver bar should be in the locked-down position. It starts that way at our warehouse, but can sometimes become dislodged during transport to your polling place. If the silver bar is not in the locked-down position, it will quickly cause ballots to jam on election morning.
