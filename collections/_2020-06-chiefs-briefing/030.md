Please review the position description for the Voting Booth Officer. You should remove this position description from the back of your Notebook and give it to the Election Officer who will serve in this position. The Voting Booth Officer should maintain 6-feet of social distancing if possible while assisting voters. Please note that it is very important for the Voting Booth Officer to quickly remove any single-use pens that a voter leaves in the voting booth. Remember that single-use pens are not to be re-used on Election Day. You should put them in the &quot;Used Pens&quot; bag.
