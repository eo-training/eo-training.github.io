---

The top part of the Request for Assistance form is filled out by the Election Officer and then given to the voter to fill out Section A.

Section B is filled out by the person who will assist the voter. In Section B, that person is affirming that they are not one of the &quot;prohibited&quot; class of people.

Once this form is completed and returned to the Chief, the voter&#39;s assistant can provide any help with the ballot.
