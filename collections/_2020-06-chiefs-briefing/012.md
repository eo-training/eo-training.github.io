---

Use blue &quot;painter&#39;s tape&quot; to mark arrows on the floor to direct voters. Direct voters into the voting room and through the voting process in a manner that will prevent them from crossing paths. Maintain 6-feet of social distance between voters, Election Officers, and anyone else in the voting room.
