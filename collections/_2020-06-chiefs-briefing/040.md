Now, let&#39;s jump forward to the day before the election! What do you do?

First, the Chief will receive the &quot;Sheriff&#39;s Envelope&quot;. This envelope contains last-minute materials, including the iSync drive with the final list of registered and absentee voters. If you are the Chief, you do not have to be home; the Sheriff&#39;s will post it at your front door. If you do not receive it by 3:00 PM, let us know immediately so we can arrange for a backup to be delivered to you.

In addition, all available officers should help setup the polling place. You must first confirm the setup day and time with your polling place â€“ don&#39;t just show up! It&#39;s especially important for the June 2020 Primary Elections because most polling places are currently closed to the public and staff may not be present.

NOTE: If your polling place is a school, you may request to setup on the Thursday, Friday, or Monday before the election. As always, confirm the details with your polling place contact.
