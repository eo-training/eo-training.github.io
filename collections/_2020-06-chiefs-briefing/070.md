title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS: What if voter has no acceptable ID?"
---

The first non-routine situation is if a voter does not have an ID when they come to the polling location. There are three alternatives for the voter.

- They can retrieve their ID from their car or home. But please do not tell them they must retrieve the ID to vote. This is not accurate. They are still eligible to vote with a Provisional Ballot.

- They can go to the Government Center on election day to get a temporary ID (they need to call the Office of Elections in advance on that day so they can be admitted since the Government Center is currently closed to the public ).

- They can vote provisionally and provide the Office of Elections an acceptable ID by 12:00 p.m. on the third day after the election.
