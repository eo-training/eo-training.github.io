title: "CLOSING THE POLLS: Required signatures"
---

There are a number of documents that require signatures from the Chief, Assistant Chief, and all Election Officers.

Use the Required Signature Checklist in the Chiefs Notebook to ensure that all officers sign all required documents. If any required document is missing an Officer&#39;s signature, we will call the Election Officer with missing signatures and they will have to come to the Office of Elections within 2 days to sign them. It&#39;s much better to make sure everything is signed on Election Day than to have to come to our office! But you should never have your officers pre-sign forms and labels during the day.
