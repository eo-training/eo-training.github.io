title: "BEFORE ELECTION DAY: Polling Place Info Sheet"
---

This is the Polling Place Info Sheet. You should have received a copy by email already and you will also receive a printed copy at your Supply Pickup time.

All information on your Polling Place Info Sheet came directly from your polling place. The Chief should contact the polling place well before election day to confirm all details listed.

If you and your polling place mutually agree to change the voting room, don&#39;t forget to notify our office.
