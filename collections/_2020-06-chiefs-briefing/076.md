title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS: Moving Conditions"
---

This slide is based on the Moving Conditions chart from the &quot;What-Ifs&quot; in the Chiefs Notebook.

First, ask the voter &quot;When did they move?&quot; There are three alternatives as you can see in column 1.

Then ask- &quot;How far did the voter move?&quot; There are 4 alternatives in columns 2 thru 5.

At the intersection of these two answers, the chart will guide you to a specific section of the &quot;What-Ifs&quot; which will give you detailed instructions on moving forward. This chart can be a bit confusing so you should familiarize yourself with using this chart. If you do have questions on election day, don&#39;t hesitate to call Voter Registration staff in the Office of Elections.
