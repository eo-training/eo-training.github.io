We will only have a Republican Primary in the 8th and 10th Congressional Districts. Voters may ask, &quot;Where is the Democratic ballot?&quot; If voters ask this question, you should tell them that the Democratic Party chose to select its candidate for the November 2020 Election for the United States Senate by means other than a primary.
