You will receive a PPE Reconciliation Sheet that reflects the quantities of each individual protective item that we provided for your polling place. Please insert the number of Face Coverings and Gloves that were used by Election Officers and reflect the number of unused Face Coverings and Gloves that you are returning. Please note that you need to return all Face Shields. You also need to return all bottles of spray disinfectant and hand sanitizer, including empty bottles. Please note that you should not open the Backup/Emergency Kit and you should return it unopened with your other materials. The Backup/Emergency Kit is only to be used after you use your other protective supplies. Please call us if you need to open the Backup/Emergency Kit. Please complete the PPE Reconciliation Sheet and return it with your PPE supplies.
