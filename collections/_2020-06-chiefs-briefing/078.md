If the voter has not moved, then they need to fill out the Affirmation of Eligibility&quot; form which can be found on pages 7.2 and 7.3 of the Chief&#39;s Notebook.

The Chief must complete Section A of the form and check option A.

The voter will complete Section B on the opposite side of the form.

You do not need to fill out the &quot;Statement of Challenger&quot; part of the form.

Once the form is completed the voter can be checked in on the Poll Pad. (Remember to check the &quot;Voter Signed Oath&quot; box.)
