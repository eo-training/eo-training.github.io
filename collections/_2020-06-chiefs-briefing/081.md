title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS: What if a voter wants to vote curbside?"
---

Voters who are over 65 or disabled are eligible to vote outside the polls. Given the current health crisis, please do not question any voter&#39;s eligibility to vote curbside.

The voter will call into the Chief or Assistant Chief and one election officer will go out to the curb and assist them.

No form is required to be filled out for this but some voters may need assistance so the election officer should take a Request for Assistance form with them.

The voter is checked in as a routine voter and the Election Officer will check the &quot;Curbside Voter&quot; box on the Poll Pad.
