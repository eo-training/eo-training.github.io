Step 7: Prepare the labels for the boxes but do not affix them. Count the number of boxes and label as shown. Using the white #3 Counted Ballots sheet, write the DS200 serial number (which can be found on the back of the DS200 screen) as well the box number. In this example, there are 2 boxes of counted ballots. The first box is labeled Box 1 of 2 and the second box is labeled Box 2 of 2. Make 2 copies for each box.
