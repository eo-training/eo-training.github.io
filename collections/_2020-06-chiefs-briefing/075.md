title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS: What if voter has moved?"
---

If the voter has moved, there are a couple of questions you need to ask: &quot;When did they move?&quot; and &quot;How far did the voter move?. These situations can be tricky, so please do not hesitate to call Voter Registration staff in the Office of Elections if you are unsure of what to do.
