title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS: What if a voter needs assistance?"
---

There are some voters who will need assistance reading, translating, or marking the ballot.

Many times, they will come with a person who will assist them. Others may need an Election Officer to assist them. Just about anyone can assist a voter but they all need to fill out this form.

The only exception is children who are age 15 or younger. They may assist without filling out the form.

Please remember that if an Election Officer assists a voter, they should still try to maintain the 6-feet of social distancing. We know this will be difficult but it&#39;s very important.
