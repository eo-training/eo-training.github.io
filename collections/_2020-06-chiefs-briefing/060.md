title: "ELECTION MORNING AND DURING THE DAY: No blue bin in DS200"
---

As of the March 2020 election, we no longer use the blue ballot bins inside the DS200 scanners. Do not be alarmed when you open and inspect your DS200 Ballot Box.

We made this change to better align with current laws and procedures. Most jurisdictions who use DS200 scanners have never used blue ballot bins.
