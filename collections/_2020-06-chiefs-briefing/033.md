Please make sure that your Election Officers demonstrate good polling place etiquette. They should always be professional, welcoming, and kind. They should always ask before offering to assist a voter and be courteous and appropriate in their verbal and non-verbal communication. They should never tell a voter that they cannot vote, never touch a voter without their permission, and never discuss political topics. They should also never tell jokes to voters or to Election Officers when voters are present.
