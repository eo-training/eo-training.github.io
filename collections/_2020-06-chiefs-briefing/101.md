You will receive 2 types of seals in the grey cart. They are found in the clear plastic portfolio on the top shelf of the cart. In the first picture on the top, there are 2 tab seals, one red and one blue. The red tab seal is used to secure the orange #7 pouch and the blue one is used to secure the blue pouch. The red zip tie seals are used to secure the voting equipment.
