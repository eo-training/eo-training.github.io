title: "ACCEPTABLE IDs: Mini-review"
---

Let&#39;s do a quick review. Which of these IDs is acceptable? Which is not? Why? Take a moment to think about these questions before you read the answer below.

- **TOP LEFT:** This is a Virginia identification card, which is on the list of valid IDs. However, look at the expiration date - it expired in 2016, which is more than 12 months ago. That means it is *not acceptable*.
- **TOP RIGHT** : This is a Maryland driver&#39;s license. This is an out-of-state license, which is not on the list of valid IDs. Therefore, it is *not acceptable*.
- **BOTTOM LEFT** : This is a school ID from the University of North Florida. As this university does not have a campus in Virginia, it is *not acceptable*.
- **BOTTOM RIGHT** : This is a voter ID with photo. You may see the 2014 date and think that automatically disqualifies it. However, remember the date that is listed is an _issue_ date, not an expiration date. So this ID *is acceptable* for voting.
