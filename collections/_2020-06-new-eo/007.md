This is the timeline before, on, and after election day.

- **PRE-ELECTION:** We strongly encourage all officers to vote absentee, especially if you are not assigned to your home precinct (Virginia law requires you to vote in your registered precinct on election day). The week before the election, the Chief will contact each officer to go over precinct-specific information, such as the building entrance and voting room you are using. The Chief and Assistant Chief will also usually do initial setup of the voting room on the day before the election - if possible, you should try to attend and help. This will also give you a chance to review the route to your polling place if you are not assigned to your home precinct.
- **DURING THE DAY:** Make sure to arrive no later than 5:00 AM and help setup. During the day, you will assist voters and refer any issues to the Chief. In the evening, you will help with closing procedures and must sign some required forms.
- **POST-ELECTION:** If you forgot to sign a required form, you will have to come to our office within 2 days to sign! After the election, you will be asked to complete a post-election survey within 3 days. Due to Fairfax County&#39;s rolling pay schedule, you will receive payment 4-6 weeks after election day.
