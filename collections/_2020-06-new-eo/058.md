The last step is to unlock and open the Ballot Compartment. With multiple officers present, carefully move all voted ballots into the voted ballot boxes and seal them. The Chief will return these ballots on election night and they will be transported to the courthouse for safekeeping.

Be sure to return all materials to the Chief, including the signed tapes, the 2 memory sticks, the printed instructions, the Machine Certification Form, and the DS200 keys.

You have now successfully learned how to open, use, and close the DS200 scanner on election day.
