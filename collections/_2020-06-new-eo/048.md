Let&#39;s continue the steps to open a DS200.

- **STEP 4** : On the back of the DS200, open the **Power Cord Compartment**. There is a silver bar which helps guide ballots into the proper compartment. Verify it is in the locked-down position. It starts that way at our warehouse but can sometimes become dislodged during transport. If all looks well, remove the power cord and plug it in. Remember to always use a surge protector between the power cord and the wall outlet! Leave this compartment open during the day.
- **STEP 5** : Unlock and open the black machine lid.
- **STEP 6** : Unlock and lift up the screen. The scanner will automatically power on.
