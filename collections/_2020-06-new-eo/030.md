title: "POLL PADS: Scan driver's license"
---

Scanning a voter&#39;s driver license is very easy! You simply place the license in the scanning tray, which is attached to the back of the Poll Pad. Make sure the barcode is facing the Poll Pad camera. Then the Poll Pad will scan the barcode and open the voter&#39;s record automatically.
