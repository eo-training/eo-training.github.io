To enter a write-in candidate, press the &quot;Write-In&quot; button to reveal a keyboard. If you have visual limitations, you can press the &quot;Contrast&quot; button to change the screen to high-contrast black-and-white. Press the &quot;Zoom&quot; button to make the ballot appear larger on the screen. You can also display the ballot in different languages or use a physical keypad to make selections.
- **STEP 3** : Review selections. After you have made your selections, you can review them before printing your ballot card. You can make changes if needed.
- **STEP 4** : Print marked ballot. Press the &quot;Print Card&quot; button and your printed card will be returned to you.
