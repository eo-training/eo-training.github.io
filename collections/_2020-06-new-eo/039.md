title: "BALLOTS & EXPRESSVOTE: Void ballots"
---

Sometimes, a voter does not complete the process of voting.

If a voter leaves their ballot in the polling place, they are a FLEEING VOTER. If they left the ballot on the DS200 scanner, you may cast it for them. Otherwise, write VOID in large letters across the face of the ballot and give it to the Chief.
