title: "ACCEPTABLE IDs: If voter has no acceptable ID..."
---

If a voter does not present an acceptable form of ID, you should always call the Chief! They are trained on alternatives, including:

- **The voter always has the option to complete a Provisional Ballot and submit their ID later**. (Some people think provisional ballots are only counted in close elections. Actually, the Electoral Board reviews all provisional ballots and every ballot they accept is included in the official results of the election.)
- **The voter can return with an acceptable ID.** However, many voters who say they will return later often do not, which is why we encourage Chiefs to still offer a provisional ballot in this situation.
- **The voter can get a temporary photo ID from the Office of Elections**. If they come to our office, we can take their photo and print a temporary ID, as you can see in the picture. These temporary IDs are treated like any other ID and are accepted for 1 year past expiration.
