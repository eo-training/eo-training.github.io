When you select a voter to check-in, you will also be presented with four possible &quot;flags&quot;:

- **ASSISTED flag:** If a voter requires assistance in marking their ballot, send them to the Chief who may select this flag. The voter and their assistant must complete a &quot;Request for Assistance&quot; form.
- **PROVISIONAL flag** : Send provisional voters to the Chief. You will ***NEVER*** use this flag or check-in provisional voters. (This software is used by many jurisdictions and we are currently unable to disable the Poll Pad flag.)
- **OUTSIDE POLLS (OP) flag**: If the Chief asks you to check-in a &quot;curbside voter&quot;, select this flag. A curbside voter is someone who is disabled or 65+ years of age and requests to stay in their car and vote outside the polls. (Do not question someone if they ask to vote curbside.)
- **VOTER SIGNED OATH flag** : If someone is an &quot;Inactive voter&quot;, send them to the Chief who may select this flag. Someone may become Inactive if they moved or have not voted in 2 consecutive federal elections. If they are permitted to vote, they must compete an Affirmation of Eligibility form (also known as an oath).

Don&#39;t forget - the last step to checking in a voter is pressing the &#39;Accept&#39; button!
