The ExpressVote is an accessible *marking* device. It marks and prints a ballot for the voter, who then inserts the printed ballot card into a DS200 to be scanned and counted. So it&#39;s like a large pen!

The ExpressVote is ADA-compliant and offers voters multiple options, including displaying the ballot in multiple languages. The voter can use the touchscreen, audio cues, or the Braille directional pad to make vote selections.

Any voter may choose to use the ExpressVote! Do not question someone&#39;s disability or motivation for using an ExpressVote.
