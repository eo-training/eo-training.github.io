Who are the people in the polling place?

- **CHIEF AND ASSISTANT CHIEF** : Work together as a team to manage the polling place. They assign and rotate election officers throughout the day. Most importantly, they are trained to handle all non-routine voter situations.
- **ELECTION OFFICERS** : Throughout the day, regular election officers greet voters, check-in voters, issue ballots, and direct voters to mark &amp; cast ballots. Some precincts may have Language Officers, who perform all regular officer duties but also assist voters who speak a different language, such as Spanish, Vietnamese, or Korean. (All Language Officers have been assessed for their language skills.)
- **HIGH SCHOOL PAGES** : Only serve in November elections. They may help in many ways, but they *are not registered voters* and *may not touch voting equipment*.
