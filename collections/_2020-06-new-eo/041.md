title: "BALLOTS & EXPRESSVOTE: Regular ballot & ExpressVote card"
---

Until now, you have likely only been familiar with the regular ballot.

But remember, if a voter chooses to use the ExpressVote accessible marking device, it prints a marked ballot card that voters can then scan themselves. This printed ballot card is equivalent to a regular ballot.

To be counted, either of these ballot types must then be inserted into a DS200 scanner.
