Here are some samples of valid IDs. It includes:

- Virginia driver&#39;s license
- Virginia identification card (sometimes colloquially referred to as a &quot;walker&#39;s license&quot;)
- Virginia voter ID *with photo* (note that it has an _issue date_, not an expiration date)
- US passport or US passport card
- US federal or military ID
- Work ID
- School ID from a school with a campus in Virginia
- Government ID from a government located in Virginia

Again, note that many of these IDs do not have an address or expiration date, but they are still valid for voting.
