**WORKING HOURS:** Election officers should be at the polling place and ready to go by 5:00 AM. The day ends *when all work is complete &amp; you are released by the Chief*. Voting ends at 7:00 PM and it takes most precincts 1-2 hours to finish closing the polling place.

**COMPENSATION:** You are paid <span>$</span>175 for a full day of service. Officers who arrive late (after 5:00 AM) may be penalized <span>$</span>25 or dismissed immediately. We strongly encourage you to set multiple alarms so this doesn&#39;t happen!

**WHAT TO BRING:** You should bring all food, medicine, and reading material you need for the day. Note that reading material may not be politically-oriented, such as a newspaper. You may bring electronic devices such as a phone or tablet, but you may not use them while assisting voters.

**WHAT TO WEAR:** Dress should be business casual. Clean, unripped jeans are acceptable. You don&#39;t know what the temperature inside the voting room will be and it can change during the day, so wear layers! Of course, clothing should not be politically-oriented or offensive in nature.

**DURING THE DAY:** You may not comment on candidates or political issues, current or past. It&#39;s very important to note that you *can&#39;t leave the polling place during the day*, so again, make sure to bring everything you need with you for the day.
