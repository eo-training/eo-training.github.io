title: "BASIC INFORMATION: Outside the Polling Place (40-foot Prohibited Area)"
---

Outside the polling place, there is a **40-Foot Prohibited Area** , which provides voters unimpeded access to the building.

State law does not permit loitering, congregating, or electioneering within 40 feet of a polling place entrance (i.e. the *building entrance*, NOT the voting room entrance). Restricted activities include **campaigning, handing out flyers,** and **bake sales**.

These activities are permitted outside of the 40-foot Prohibited Area.
