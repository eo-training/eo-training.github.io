**POLL WATCHERS:** Authorized representatives of a party or candidate. Poll Watchers are allowed anywhere inside a polling place as long as they don&#39;t impede voters or touch voting equipment. Poll Watchers may stay and observe closing procedures; but if they do, they cannot leave the room or report results early.

**NEWS MEDIA &amp; INTERVIEWS:** Call the Chief if someone wants to interview you! You may provide basic facts (e.g. number of voters checked in), but do not give opinions or forecasts. For anything further, call the Office of Elections.

**ELECTRONICS:** Voters ARE allowed to use personal electronic devices inside a polling place to take photos, make calls, etc. They are also allowed to take a &quot;selfie&quot; of themselves and/or their ballot. If they want to take a photo that includes other voters, they must ask for and receive permission from those voters first.
