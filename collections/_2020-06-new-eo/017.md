title: "ACCEPTABLE IDs: Overview"

There are certain things you must look for on any ID a voter presents:

- **Is there a name and photo?** All IDs *must* have both to be eligible for voting.
- **Is there an expiration date?** This is *optional*. But if there is an expiration date listed, it must not have expired more than 12 months ago. (Yes, that means a voter can present a recently-expired ID.)
- **Ignore the address, if listed**. Instead, you will only consider the address the voter provides you during the check-in process.

<span style="color:red;"><strong>NOTE: You may have heard the law regarding photo IDs recently changed. This does not take effect until July 1, 2020, which is after the June primary election. We will provide more information about the exact changes at that time.</strong></span>
