title: "POLL PADS: Mini-review"
---

Let&#39;s do a quick review. Take a moment to think about these questions before you read the answer below.

- **What time must you arrive? When can you leave?** All election officers must arrive no later than 5:00 AM and stay until the Chief dismisses everyone.
- **Is an ID required to have: ...a photo? ...an address? ...an expiration date?** A voter&#39;s ID is required to have a photo. It does not have to have an address (in fact, if there is an address present, you will ignore it in favor of the address the voter provides orally or in writing). It does not have to have an expiration date (but if there is one visible, it must not be expired more than 12 months).
- **Which Poll Pad flag will you never use?** You will never use the Provisional flag on the Poll Pads. Always send provisional voters to the Chief.
- **What should you do if you&#39;re not sure how to handle a non-routine voter or any other situation?** If you&#39;re not sure about anything on election day, just say one simple word: &quot;CHIEF!&quot; Again, Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs are trained to handle all non-routine situations.
