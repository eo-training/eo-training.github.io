Congratulations! You have now completed the online class for New Election Officers.

To receive credit for this class, you must still take and pass the quiz. You can find the quiz in the [Election Officer Portal](https://www.vote4fairfax.com). Login, go to the Training tab, scroll down, and look in the bottom-right for a link labeled &quot;Quiz&quot;. If you do not pass the quiz the first time, you can take it again until you pass.
