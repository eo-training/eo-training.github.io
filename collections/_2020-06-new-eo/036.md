title: "POLL PADS: Send to Chief!"
---

Remember, MOST check-ins are very simple. For the ones that aren&#39;t, just refer the voter to the Chief.

Some issues that you may encounter that you should refer to the Chief include:

- If the voter&#39;s name is misspelled in the pollbook or they had a name change,
- If the voter has moved or is in the wrong precinct,
- If the voter has no acceptable ID,
- If the voter cannot be found in the pollbook,
- If the voter requested an absentee ballot but is at the polling place,
- And, of course, anything related to provisional ballots.
