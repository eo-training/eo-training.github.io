title: "DS200 SCANNER: Ballots accepted by scanner"
---

When a voter inserts a **regularly marked ballot** , the DS200 will accept and scan it. Voters should be encouraged to wait at the machine until they hear a &quot;clunk&quot; sound as the ballot drops inside and the &quot;Thank You&quot; screen is displayed.

You will also see this screen if the voter has an **under-voted ballot**. This means the voter voted for fewer candidates or contests than they were allowed. For example, in a presidential election, some voters will only vote for president and no other contests on the ballot. Again, in this case, the DS200 will accept the ballot without issue and the &quot;Thank You&quot; screen is displayed.
