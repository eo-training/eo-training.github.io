We&#39;re almost done opening a DS200!

- **STEP 9** : Verify that the &quot;Public Count&quot; at the top of the screen is zero. The Public Count indicates the number of votes cast in the current election on this machine - at the start of the day, it will always be zero! Also verify the &quot;Protected Count&quot; matches the number pre-printed in the green table on the Machine Certification Form. This number is like a car odometer - it tells you how many ballots have been cast in the lifetime of this machine, across all elections. If the number does not match, call the Chief.
- **STEP 10** : At 6:00 AM on election day, press the green &quot;Go to Voting Mode&quot; button. The DS200 is now ready to accept ballots!

Be sure to return all materials to the Chief, including the signed tapes, the cut green zip-tie seal, the printed instructions, the Machine Certification Form, and the DS200 keys.
