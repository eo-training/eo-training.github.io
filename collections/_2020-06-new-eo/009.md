These are the 3 types of voting equipment used in the polling place. We will go into more detail about each type of voting equipment later in this training.

- **POLL PAD** : This is an iPad-based tablet device used to check-in each voter. It is also sometimes called an electronic pollbook.
- **EXPRESSVOTE:** This is a ballot _marking_ device. It&#39;s like a big pen! It prints a marked ballot card that voters can then scan themselves. This device is especially helpful for voters who cannot read or mark a regular ballot easily.
- **DS200 SCANNER:** This is the device voters use to _cast_ their ballot. It automatically scans and counts all votes.
