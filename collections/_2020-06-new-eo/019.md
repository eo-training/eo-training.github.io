There are also many IDs that you cannot accept for voting.

- A Virginia driver&#39;s license is OK, but an out-of-state driver&#39;s license is not.
- An ID from a school with a campus in Virginia is OK, but an ID from a school with no presence in Virginia is not. (On election day, the Chief has a list of all colleges and universities with campuses in Virginia.)
- A US passport is OK, but a foreign passport is not.
- A voter ID with a photo is OK, but an older voter ID without a photo is not.
- An ID from a person&#39;s employer, regardless whether they are located in Virginia, DC, Maryland, or elsewhere is OK. But other non-government and non-school IDs, such as a credit card or Costco membership card, are not OK.

You will have a full list of acceptable IDs at the check-in table on election day.
