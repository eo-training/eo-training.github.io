Congratulations! You have now completed the online class for New Chiefs & Assistant Chiefs.

To receive credit for this class, you must still take and pass the quiz. You can find the quiz in the Election Officer Portal. Go to the Training tab, scroll down, and look in the bottom-right for a link labeled "Quiz". If you do not pass the quiz the first time, you can take it again. You can have these training materials open to reference as you take the quiz.

This class is now complete. Thank you and we know you'll do great on election day!
