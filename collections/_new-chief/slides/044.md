This is a sample of a provisional notice. You must give each provisional voter this notice, which tells them more about how and when their provisional ballot will be adjudicated.

For no-ID provisional voters, it also outlines the ways they can submit a copy of their ID to have it be counted. A voter can submit their ID by email, by fax, in-person at our office, or by postal mail. We strongly encourage you to remind voters that email may be the easiest option - they could go home, take a picture of their ID on their phone, and email it to us.
