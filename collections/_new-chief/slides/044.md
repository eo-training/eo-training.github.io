title: "PROVISIONAL BALLOTS: Two kinds of provisional ballots"
---

There are 2 kinds of provisional ballots. They both use slightly different shades of green.

-   If a voter has no ID, you will use the **lime green** envelope on the left.
-   For registration, absentee, and other issues, you will use the **regular green** envelope on the right.

Generally speaking, only about 15% of provisional voters are because they do not have their ID, while 85% are for other issues. So for the most part, you will be using the **regular green** envelope.
