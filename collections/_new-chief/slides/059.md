**PART F:** This is the last section of the SOR and is usually printed on the back. This is where you account for the number of votes in each contest. This is usually the easiest section to fill out because you are simply copying the vote totals from the DS200 tapes.

- In this example, the first contest for NASA Apollo Hall of Fame is between Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. We can see they each received 30 votes (when you add up the numbers from the first DS200 and the second DS200) and there were 10 write-in votes. You will also notice there were 0 over-votes on each DS200. (Remember, an overvote occurs if a voter votes for more choices than allowed in a particular contest.)
- In the second contest, for US Astronaut Hall of Fame, we can see that Sally Ride and Alan Shepard each received 50 votes and there were 0 write-in votes.

Again, all of these numbers will come directly from your DS200 tapes. The only thing you will have to do is add them up.
