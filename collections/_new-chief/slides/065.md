A very important reminder about signatures:

- Assign one officer to double-check that all forms and labels requiring signatures have been signed properly.
- If any required documents are missing an officer's signature, we will call that officer to come into the office within 2 days to sign them.
- It's much better to make sure everything is signed on election day than to have to come to our office!
- But as before, do not have your officers pre-sign forms and labels during the day.

This is a topic very near and dear to our heart. We have had some elections with more than 150 missing signatures and we had to call all of those people to come to our office. We really want to get that down to zero! There is a Signature Reminder Checklist in your Chiefs Notebook that you can use to make sure everything is signed properly before leaving your precinct on election day.

Be a hero, have zero missing signatures!
