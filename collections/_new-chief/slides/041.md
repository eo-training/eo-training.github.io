Also, a reminder that you should **NOT** check in provisional voters on your Poll Pad. In Virginia, provisional voters are never marked on the pollbook because we do not know yet if their ballot will be counted.

In addition, do **NOT** let voters cast provisional ballots on the DS200 scanner. It's very important to help provisional voters at the Chief's Table, far away from the DS200 scanner. Once you issue a ballot to a provisional voter, stay with them until they return it to you.
