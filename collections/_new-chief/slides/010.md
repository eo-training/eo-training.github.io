- [PDF: 2020-11 Chiefs Notebook](https://admin.vote4fairfax.com/Uploadfile/file/2020-11%20Chiefs%20Notebook%20(final%20compressed)%20-%20v3.pdf)

All Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs are issued a Chiefs Notebook before each election. This class is designed to give you an overview of everything you need to know, but you will also have your Chiefs Notebook on election day to easily double-check and reference how to handle any situation.

You will receive your Chiefs Notebook about 1 week before election day. It's very important for you to familiarize yourself with the content BEFORE election day, so that you know where to look when you need to help a non-routine voter or to handle a situation on election day.
