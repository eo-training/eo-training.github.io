title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS, PART 2: Mini-review"
---

Let's do a quick review! Take a moment to think about these questions before you read the answers below.

1.  **What 3 tasks should you complete approximately one week before election day?** You should attend a Chiefs Briefing, visit your polling place, and the Chief should contact all election officers.
2.  **Do Inactive voters (who have not moved) vote normally or provisionally?** Inactive voters can vote NORMALLY after they complete an Affirmation of Eligibility form. 
3.  **What should you do if a voter brings their mailed absentee ballot with them?** If a voter brings their mailed absentee ballot, they should surrender it to you. You will mark it as "absentee spoiled" and then allow the voter to vote normally.
4.  **What should you do if you're not 100% sure how to handle a voter who has moved or other non-routine situations?** Call the office! We are here to help. The most important thing is to make sure we process each voter correctly. And once you feel more comfortable, you will be able to process most non-routine voters yourself.
