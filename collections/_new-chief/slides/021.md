This is an example of an **Affirmation of Eligibility** form, which you will use for Inactive voters.

On the front side of the form, an election officer must complete Section A with some basic information like the precinct number and date. Do not fill out the "Statement of Challenger" section for an Inactive voter - we will explain this section later in this training.

On the back side of the form, the voter must complete Section B with their information. This includes their name, signature, address, contact info, and more.

That's it! Now the Affirmation of Eligibility form is complete and, as we mentioned, the voter may be checked-in on the Poll Pad and vote normally. Remember to select the "Voter Signed Oath" flag on the Poll Pad.
