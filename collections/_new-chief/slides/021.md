title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS, PART 1: Poll Pad flags"
---

As a reminder, when you check-in a voter on the Poll Pad, you are presented with different flags that you may select. For the next 3 non-routine voter situations, you will need to select one of these flags.

-   If a voter requires assistance, you will select the **Assisted** flag.
-   If a voter wants to vote curbside, you will select the **Outside Polls (OP)** flag.
-   If a voter is Inactive, you will select the **Voter Signed Oath** flag.
-   If a voter does not have an ID, they have the option of completing an ID Confirmation Statement. If they do, select the **Voter Signed Oath** flag (after required form is completed).
-   Remember, provisional voters are never checked-in on the Poll Pad, so you will not use the **Provisional** flag.
