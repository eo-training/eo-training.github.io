Now it's election morning. What do you need to do?

- **Swear in officers at 5:00 AM**. Don't wait for late officers; you can swear them in when they arrive. The important part is to swear in the officers who are present, so you can get started.
- **Delegate tasks and work in parallel.** Split up tasks among your officers and have them get started. Put your best officers on the most important tasks, including setting up the Poll Pads, setting up the DS200 scanners, and opening and counting the ballots.
- **Open polls promptly at 6:00 AM.** You must open the polls on time, even if you haven't finished lower-priority tasks like putting up signs.
