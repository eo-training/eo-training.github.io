Don't forget to add the provisional voter to your Provisional Ballot Log!

Again, you will copy over some basic info and select a reason code. In this case, the voter has no ID, which means you mark an 'x' in the "ID" column. (This is explained in the small text at the bottom of the page and on page 20 of the What-Ifs.)

Leave the two rightmost columns blank for the Electoral Board to use.
