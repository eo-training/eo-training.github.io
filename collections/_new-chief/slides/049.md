Now, let's practice a provisional situation!

**Johnny Citizen wants to vote, but the only identification he has with him is an employee ID without a photo.**

As you know from the Changes to Virginia Election Laws training, an employee ID is the only ID which is explicitly required to have a photo; if it does note have a photo, it is not an acceptable ID for voting. If this voter does not have another valid ID with them and does not complete an ID Confirmation Statement, you should offer them a provisional ballot.
