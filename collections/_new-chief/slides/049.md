Now, let's practice a provisional situation!

**Johnny Citizen wants to vote, but the only photo identification he has with him is a Costco membership card.**

As you know from being a regular election officer, a Costco membership card may have a photo but it is NOT an acceptable ID for voting. If this voter does not have another valid ID with them, you should offer them a provisional ballot.
