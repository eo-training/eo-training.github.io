Let's continue the example with a voter with no acceptable ID who chooses to complete a provisional ballot.

- Because this is a no-ID provisional situation, you will use the **lime green** envelope.
- The officer helping the provisional voter completes 3 fields: the precinct number and name in the top right and your signature and today's date towards the bottom.
- The voter completes all other fields, including their name, address, and date of birth. And don't forget the most important thing - check to make sure the voter signed the envelope!

Do not mark or write anything on the back of the no-ID provisional envelope. That is for the Electoral Board.
