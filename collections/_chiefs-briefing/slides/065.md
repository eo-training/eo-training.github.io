What if a voter wants to vote curbside?

Voters who are over 65 or disabled are eligible to vote outside the polls. Do not question any voter's eligibility to vote curbside.

The voter will call the curbside number displayed on the large yellow A-frame sandwich sign. Two election officers should go out to the curb and assist them. (Do not take Poll Pads outside.)

No form is required for someone to be able to vote curbside. However, some curbside voters may need assistance so election officers should take a Request for Assistance form with them.

Make sure to check the "Outside Polls" flag on the Poll Pad for any curbside voters.
