We will provide you with 15 Round Blue Social Distancing Signs to place on the floor in 6-foot intervals.

If your voting room is in a school, school staff will provide you with large cones and you should tape the Round Blue Social Distancing Signs to the cones and place them in 6-foot intervals.

In other locations, use blue painter's tape to **tape** the signs to the floor.

**IMPORTANT: Do not stick the round signs directly to the floor. Tape them to the cones or the floor.**

You can use the tape in addition (if necessary) to mark X's on the floor in 6-Foot Intervals.
