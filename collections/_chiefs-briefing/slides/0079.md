When your election officers have a voter they cannot check in on the Poll Pad and need to refer to the Chief, have them fill out a Voter Referral Worksheet with the "reason for the referral" box checked off. This worksheet will help you understand the issue you need to resolve and where to find it in the "What-Ifs" section of your Chiefs Notebook.
