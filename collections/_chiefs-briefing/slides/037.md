As previously mentioned, you will have a new purple pouch.

When you shut down the DS200s, you will take out the USB flash drives and put them in this pouch. We have already given you a zip-tie seal inside the pouch that you can use to seal it.

Then give the pouch to the Absentee Ballot Collector officers to immediately transport to the Fairfax County Government Center.
