Welcome to the online pre-election Chiefs Briefing for the June 8, 2021 Democratic Party Primary Election!

During this online Briefing, we will do our best to provide you with the same type of detailed information that we usually provide during in-person Briefings.

We will also provide you with information on our Action Plan for Polling Place Operations during COVID-19.

In addition, you will have an opportunity to participate in an optional Zoom question and answer session on Friday, June 4 at 2:00 p.m.
