As soon as the Absentee Ballot Collectors have the absentee ballots and the purple pouch, they should leave immediately to drive to the Fairfax County Government Center. This should be no later than 7:30 PM.

Absentee Ballot Collectors will not sign the SOR or other closing documents.

Absentee Ballot Collector officers are encouraged to drive together in the same car, if possible (especially if vaccinated). But if they prefer, they may drive separately.
