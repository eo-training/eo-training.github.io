On the Poll Pad, you will receive a special prompt for HAVA voters.

To proceed, the HAVA voter must show you one of the following IDs, per the Code of Virginia:

- A current and valid photo identification (from the list of acceptable IDs)
- A copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows the name and address of the voter.

For example, a student ID with photo is acceptable for all voters, including HAVA voters. However, a student ID without photo could be used by most voters, but not a HAVA voter.

IMPORTANT: If a HAVA voter does not have an acceptable ID, the ID Confirmation Statement is NOT sufficient. Instead, they may complete a provisional ballot. However, there is a special "HAVA-ID Provisional Voter Notice" specifically for HAVA voters without acceptable ID. Do not give the regular no-ID provisional notice to a HAVA voter.
