If the voter chooses to vote provisionally, provide them with a Provisional Vote Envelope, Provisional Voter Notice and a ballot. Use the Lime Green Provisional Envelope for ID provisional voters and the darker green envelope for all other provisional voters.

Remember - it is critical that the envelope is filled out completely and the voter and the Election Officer both sign the Provisional Ballot Envelope.
