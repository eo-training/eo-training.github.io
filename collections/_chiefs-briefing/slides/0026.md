**Important Notes**

Initially, we planned to have the Chief Officers return absentee ballots from the Absentee Ballot Drop-off Boxes with their other election materials that they return at the Fairfax County Government Center or Mount Vernon Government Center. We changed this plan, and assigned two Absentee Ballot Collectors at each polling place, to keep live absentee ballots separate from the other election materials and to get them back to the Fairfax County Government Center in a quick and efficient manner.

As a result, the information in the Absentee Ballot Drop-off Box Closing Procedures section of your Election Manual at the bottom of page 1.5 (where it says that the Chief will return these absentee ballots) is incorrect.

Please call Election Administration staff at 703-324-4735 if you have any questions.
