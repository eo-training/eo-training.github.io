As soon as you complete the SOR candidate totals sections, you should copy the information over to your call sheets.

You should have two call sheets: a **buff** color one that you will post at the precinct and a **blue one** that the Chiefs will drive back on election night.

As soon as you've filled out your call sheets, call in your results.

If you are not able to call in your results by 8:00 PM, you should call your Rover so they may help you if needed.
