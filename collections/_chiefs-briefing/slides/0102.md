Follow the instructions in Section 8 of the Chiefs Notebook to complete your Statement of Results (SOR).

You should complete the back page, with the candidate totals, first. This way, you can call in your results as soon as possible. A lot of people are waiting to find out who won!

IMPORTANT: Remember though that all election officers should focus on closing the polls. Do not let anyone get distracted with speculating about which candidates may be ahead or will win.
