If you have Poll Watchers, you must collect a written authorization form from them. They cannot simply show you an email on their phone.

Remember that once authorized, Poll Watchers may move around within a voting room. They may observe, but not interact with voters. If they see an issue, they should talk to you directly as the Chief or Assistant Chief.

**IMPORTANT** : In this election, you may have individuals who come to the polling place and want to serve as unauthorized Poll Watchers. Remember, if they do not submit a written authorization form to you that is signed by the county or state chair of their party, they cannot serve as Poll Watchers. If you have any issues with unauthorized Poll Watchers, call our office on election day for assistance.
