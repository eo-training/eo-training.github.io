First, you should have received a Precinct Roster by email. You will also receive a printed copy at your Supply Pickup time.

The Precinct Roster contains information for all of your election officers, including their name, phone number, email address, how many elections they have previously worked, and any additional languages they may speak.

If you have a Language Officer on your roster, that is an individual who has been assessed for their language skills in Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, or Farsi. They perform all regular election officer duties but may also assist voters who speak a second language.
