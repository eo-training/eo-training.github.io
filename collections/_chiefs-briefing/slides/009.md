For this election, each precinct needs 5 to 7 election officers. However, we have assigned at least 1 extra officer in almost all precincts, so you should have 6 to 8 election officers in most polling places.

This includes:

- **Chief and Assistant Chief**: Manage the polling place and work with non-routine voters.
- **PPE Specialist**: Regular officer who helps manage PPE supplies and sanitize voting surfaces as needed.
- **Language Officers**: Regular officer who help voters needing language assistance as needed.
- **Absentee Ballot Collectors**: Regular officers who drive absentee ballots to the Fairfax County Government Center after polls close.
- **Regular Officers**: Perform all regular election officer duties.
