When closing procedures begin (at 7:00 PM or after the last voter in line has voted), the Absentee Ballot Collector officers should be outside the voting room with the Drop-Off Box.

They will remove and count the absentee ballot envelopes, then secure them in a large manila envelope.

On the front of the envelope, they will tape a pink sheet that indicates how many absentee ballot envelopes are inside.

On the back of the envelope, they will secure it with red tamper tape and then apply a signature seal.

They should then disassemble the Drop-Off Box and pack it in the cardboard box again.

We will provide Chiefs, Assistant Chiefs, and Absentee Ballot Collector officers with more detailed instructions by email before election day.
