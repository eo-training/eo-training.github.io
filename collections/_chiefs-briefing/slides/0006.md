**ABSENTEE BALLOT DROP-OFF BOXES**

- An Absentee Ballot Drop-off Box will be located just outside the voting room at each polling place.
- You should assemble the Drop-off Box before Election Day. The Drop-off Box must be monitored by an Election Officer between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on Election Day.
- We have designated two Officers as Absentee Ballot Collectors. These individuals will be responsible for counting and securing voted absentee ballots at 7:00 p.m. and immediately driving them to the Fairfax County Government Center. The Absentee Ballot Collectors will also be responsible for emptying the Drop-Off Box and securing absentee ballots during the day if the Drop-Off Box is full.
- At the end of the Election Day, after the two Absentee Ballot Collectors have removed, counted, and secured all of the absentee ballots, please take apart the Drop-Off Box and put it back in the box that it came in. Then put the box on top of the Voting Equipment Cart.
