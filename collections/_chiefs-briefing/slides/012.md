As you may recall from the New and Experienced Election Officer training class, the Poll Pad app has been updated!

The new Poll Pad app looks different, but functions very similarly to the previous version. All the buttons and features are in basically the same places.

On election day, we will have lots of staff in our Technical Command Center, ready and able to help you with any Poll Pad questions. Don't hesitate to call us if you need help!
