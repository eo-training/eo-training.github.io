If the Inacitve voter has not moved, then they need to fill out the "Affirmation of Eligibility" form.

The Chief must complete Section A of the form and check option A.

The voter will complete Section B on the opposite side of the form.

You do not need to fill out the "Statement of Challenger" part of the form.

Once the form is completed the voter can be checked in on the Poll Pad. (Remember to check the "Voter Signed Oath" flag on the Poll Pad.)
