Voters who are over 65 or disabled are eligible to vote outside the polls. Given the current health crisis, do not question any voter's eligibility to vote curbside.

The voter will call the curbside number and two election officers will go out to the curb and assist them.

No form is required for someone to be able to vote curbside, but some voters may need assistance so the election officer should take a Request for Assistance form with them.

The voter can vote routinely, as long as the Election Officer checks the "Outside Polls" flag on the Poll Pad.
