What if a voter needs assistance?

Some voters need help reading, translating, or marking the ballot. Sometimes, they will come with a person who will assist them. Others may need an Election Officer to assist them.

A voter and their assistant must complete the Request for Assistance form. Once this form is completed and returned to the Chief, the voter's assistant can provide any help with the ballot.

(The only exception is children who are age 15 or younger. They may assist without filling out the form.)

Please remember that if an Election Officer assists a voter, they should still try to maintain the 6-feet of social distancing. We know this will be difficult but it's very important.
