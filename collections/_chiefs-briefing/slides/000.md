**ELECTION DAY**

On Tuesday, June 8, 2021, registered voters in Fairfax County can vote in the Democratic Party Primary to choose candidates for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General. In addition, registered voters in many of the county's polling places can vote in the Democratic Primary to choose a candidate for the House of Delegates. Polling places will be open from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

**VOTING EQUIPMENT, POLL PADS, AND BALLOTS**

We have allocated 2 DS200 voting machines, 2 ExpressVote machines, 3 to 6 Poll Pads, 1 to 3 boxes of ballots, and 110 ExpressVote cards to each precinct. You should set up one DS200 and one ExpressVote machine. The second DS200 and the second ExpressVote machine will be available as a backup.

**NON-ROUTINE AND PROVISIONAL VOTERS**

You are required to offer a provisional ballot to any voter who is not able to vote at your precinct in the routine manner. At the same time, you are also responsible for directing voters to the correct precinct so they will have the best chance of having their ballot count. Call voter registration staff at **703-324-8765** if you have any questions about Non-Routine or provisional voters on Election Day.

Each precinct will receive ballots for 30% of your registered voters. All ballots are 14-inches in length and are 1-sided.

All voters in Fairfax County will have the opportunity to vote on the Democratic nominees for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General.

Voters in some precincts will have the opportunity to vote on a Democratic nominee for the state House of Delegates.

Based on new guidance from the Commonwealth of Virginia, we have updated the requirements regarding use of face coverings by election officers in a polling place:

- If you are fully vaccinated, you are no longer required to wear a face covering while working at the polls. The Office of Elections still encourages election officers to wear a face covering when assisting voters.

- If you are not fully vaccinated, you must continue to wear a face covering at all times when at a voting station in the voting room. If you are unable to wear a face mask, you may wear a face shield. You may remove your face covering when you are on break, away from a voting station.

- **IMPORTANT** : Do not ask other election officers to provide proof of vaccination status.

NOTE: If your polling place building has more specific requirements about face masks, you will have to adhere to those.




---
section: "OVERVIEW"
title: "Slide 8"
title: ""
layout: slide
---

- **Voters can enter the polling place and vote even if they are not wearing a face covering.**
- Maintain 6 feet for social distancing between everyone in the polling place.
- We are assigning a **PPE Specialist** officer to each precinct to ensure safety procedures are followed, manage PPE supplies, and help sanitize voting surfaces as needed.
- We are providing each precinct:
- **Clear acrylic sneeze guards** for use at Check-In Table, Ballot Table, and Chief's Table.
- **Face masks** for election officers.
- **Disinfectant spray** to sanitize voting booths and other surfaces.
- **Alcohol wipes** to clean Poll Pad and ExpressVote screens.
- **Hand sanitizer** for election officers to use throughout the day and for voters to use as they exit the polling place.




---
section: "OVERVIEW"
title: "Slide 9"
title: ""

---

For this election, each precinct needs 5 to 7 election officers. However, we have assigned at least 1 extra officer in almost all precincts, so you should have 6 to 8 election officers in most polling places.

This includes:

- **Chief and Assistant Chief**: Manage the polling place and work with non-routine voters.
- **PPE Specialist**: Regular officer who helps manage PPE supplies and sanitize voting surfaces as needed.
- **Language Officers**: Regular officer who help voters needing language assistance as needed.
- **Absentee Ballot Collectors**: Regular officers who drive absentee ballots to the Fairfax County Government Center after polls close.
- **Regular Officers**: Perform all regular election officer duties.

In the "Handouts" section of your Chiefs Notebook, we provide salmon-colored position description pages. You should remove these from your Notebook and place them near each station in the voting room.

Election officers will rotate among the following duties during election day:

- **Voter Information Officer**: Greet voters, answer questions
- **Pollbook Officer**: Check in voters on Poll Pad
- **Ballot Officer**: Issue ballots to voters
- **Voting Booth Officer**: Instruct voters at voting booths
- **Voting Machine Officer**: Instruct voters at DS200 scanner
- **Drop-Off Box Officer**: Monitor the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box

Note that the Drop-Off Box Officer is the individual who will monitor the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. You can rotate this position and have different officers perform this function throughout the day. This position is different from the two Absentee Ballot Collectors, who are responsible for counting and securing absentee ballots at 7:00 p.m. and taking them to the Fairfax County Government Center.

The Virginia General Assembly passed legislation impacting the requirements for Voter IDs at polling places that took effect on July 1, 2020. There were also minor additional changes that took effect on January 1, 2021. You will have a one-page list of all acceptable IDs that you can check at any time.

Remember, there are many additional IDs that may now be accepted, including:

- Virginia driver's license or other DMV-issued ID card (regardless of expiration date)
- Voter confirmation documents
- US college/university ID with photo (campus located anywhere outside Virginia)
- A copy of a current (within 12 months) utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document containing the name and address of the voter.

Digital copies of some IDs are now acceptable including a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document with the voter's name and address.

As you may recall from the New and Experienced Election Officer training class, the Poll Pad app has been updated!

The new Poll Pad app looks different, but functions very similarly to the previous version. All the buttons and features are in basically the same places.

One aspect that is different is the Advanced Voter search. You should only use the Advanced Voter search to look up someone by Voter ID. If you need to look someone up by address, call the office. Otherwise, it may cause an issue on your Poll Pad.

On election day, we will have lots of staff in our Technical Command Center, ready and able to help you with any Poll Pad questions. Don't hesitate to call us if you need help!

Each polling place will receive one Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box. This Drop-Off Box will be used by voters who wish to deposit their completed absentee ballot envelopes.

Voters from anywhere in Fairfax County can return completed absentee ballot envelopes in a Drop-Off Box at any polling place.




---
section: "OVERVIEW"
title: "Slide 14"
title: ""
layout: slide
---

You should assemble the absentee ballot drop-off box before election day.

The drop-off box should be located just outside the building entrance for the polling place, away from the line of voters, in an area that is visible to voters.

The election officer who monitors the drop-off box should also look for curbside voters and notify the Chief/Assistant Chief when there is a curbside voter.

The drop-off box must be monitored by an election officer from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on election day.

If practical, the individual who monitors the drop-off box should also serve as the Greeter.

Voters are not required to provide identification or identify themselves when they place a voted absentee ballot envelope in the drop-off box.

Voters are permitted to place more than one voted absentee ballot envelope in the drop-off box.

We have designated two officers as absentee ballot collectors. These individuals will be responsible for counting and securing voted absentee ballots at 7:00 p.m. and taking these ballots, along with the purple pouch containing the election media from the DS200s, to the parking lot at the Fairfax County Government Center.

The absentee ballot collectors will also be responsible for emptying the drop-off box and securing absentee ballots during the day if the drop-off box is full.

**Closing Procedures**

- The Absentee Ballot Collectors must be stationed at the drop-off box at 7:00 p.m.
- After any voter present at 7:00 p.m. has placed their voted absentee ballot in the drop-off box, the Absentee Ballot Collectors will open the drop-off box and count the number of voted absentee ballot envelopes.
- The Absentee Ballot Collectors will place the ballots in a large manila envelope.
- The Absentee Ballot Collectors will then place a seal on the manila envelope with the name of the precinct, the date, the number of absentee ballot envelopes, and their signatures. They will also complete and sign a Ballot Collector form.
- **NEW** : The two Absentee Ballot Collectors will also take custody of a sealed Purple Pouch containing election media from the DS200 voting machines.
- The Absentee Ballot Collectors should immediately drive the absentee ballots and the Purple Pouch to the Fairfax County Government Center at 12000 Government Center Parkway.

**Closing Procedures**

- During Closing Procedures, you should first prioritize shutting down the DS200 scanners and removing the USB flash drives.
- Place 4 USB flash drives (2 from each DS200) in the purple pouch.
- Give the purple pouch to the Absentee Ballot Collectors as soon as possible. (They are not permitted inside the voting room during closing procedures, so hand it to them through a doorway or window.)
- As soon as the Absentee Ballot Collectors have the absentee ballot envelopes and the purple pouch, they should immediately leave to drive to the Fairfax County Government Center (no later than 7:30 p.m.).
- We will provide more detailed written instructions to all Chiefs, Assistant Chiefs, and Absentee Ballot Collectors before election day.

All Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs must pickup essential election supplies the week before election day.

Everyone will receive a Chiefs Notebook and election supply envelope at your Supply Pickup time.

Usually, the Chief in each precinct receives just a black rolling kit. This election, the Chief will also receive some PPE materials (in one cardboard box and one large Zip-Loc bag).

If you are the Chief, please make sure you have enough space in your car to take all these materials with you. We will have a staff member take them to your car and help load them inside.




---
section: "BEFORE ELECTION DAY - TASKS"
title: "Slide 19"

You should have received a Precinct Roster by email. You will also receive a printed copy at your Supply Pickup time.

The Precinct Roster contains information for all of your election officers, including their name, phone number, email address, how many elections they have previously worked, and any additional languages they may speak.

If you have a Language Officer on your roster, that is an individual who has been assessed for their language skills in Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, or Farsi. They perform all regular election officer duties but may also assist voters who speak a language other than English.

This is the Polling Place Info Sheet. You should have received a copy by email already and you will also receive a printed copy at your Supply Pickup time.

All information on your Polling Place Info Sheet came directly from your polling place. The Chief should contact the polling place well before election day to confirm all details listed.

If you and your polling place mutually agree to change the voting room, send an email to notify our office.

OK, you've watched the Chiefs Briefing and picked up your election materials. What else do you need to do the week before election day?

First, both the Chief and Assistant Chief should submit their curbside phone numbers. If your cell phone number on file is the curbside phone number you want to use, you do not need to take any further action. We will pre-print both the Chief and Assistant Chief's curbside number; on election day, you can select either number and insert it into your curbside voting sign.

Next, the Chief should contact all election officers. Go over information specific to your precinct and answer any questions your officers may have, especially those serving for the first time.

Lastly, the Chief should contact the polling place. If possible, visit the week before and meet your building contact, inspect the voting room, and verify your voting equipment has arrived.

Now, let's jump forward to the day before the election! What do you do?

First, the Chief will receive the Sheriff's Envelope. This envelope contains last-minute materials, including the iSync drive with the final list of registered and absentee voters. If you are the Chief, you do not have to be home; the Sheriffs will post it at your front door. If you do not receive it by 3:00 PM, let us know immediately so we can arrange for a backup to be delivered to you.

In addition, all available officers should help setup the polling place. (You must first confirm the setup day and time with your polling place – don't just show up!)




---
section: "BEFORE ELECTION DAY - TASKS"
title: "Slide 23"
title: ""

When you visit your polling place, either the week before election day or during setup, verify that you received:

- Gray supply cart
- Yellow A-frame curbside voting sign
- Cardboard box containing Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box
- Cardboard box containing Acrylic Sneeze Guards

IMPORTANT: Check the precinct number on the gray cart is correct. If it is not, let us know immediately.

This is the Demonstration Ballot with a generic Mount Rushmore election. You can use it to point and show voters how to fill in the circles on the ballot.

**Do not use** the real sample ballot to do this. If you point at circles or candidates on the real sample ballot, voters will think you are trying to encourage them to vote for that candidate.

What's the first thing you should do on election morning? Swear in your officers! But if any officers are late, don't wait – swear in the officers who are present and start delegating tasks.

If any officers have not arrived by 5:30 AM, call our office. We will send out replacement officers, if possible.

The iSync drive arrives in the Sheriff's Envelope that the Chief receives. Do not forget to bring it on election morning! Our suggestion? Put it in your black rolling kit, so you can't possibly forget it.

A very important reminder: make sure you insert the iSync drive into each and every Poll Pad in use! Remember, the iSync drive contains the most updated list of registered voters and absentee voters. If you do not use the iSync drive, your Poll Pads will be out-of-date.

If you have Poll Watchers, you must collect a written authorization form from them. They cannot simply show you an email on their phone.

Remember that once authorized, Poll Watchers may move around within a voting room. They may observe, but not interact with voters. If they see an issue, they should talk to you directly as the Chief or Assistant Chief.

Please make sure that your Election Officers demonstrate good polling place etiquette.

They should always be professional, welcoming, and kind. They should always ask before offering to assist a voter and be courteous and appropriate in their verbal and non-verbal communication.

They should never tell a voter that they cannot vote, never touch a voter without their permission, and never discuss political topics.

What if a voter does not have an acceptable ID?

As of July 2020, remember that a voter can now complete the ID Confirmation Statement. If a voter completes this statement, they are eligible to then vote normally. It's that simple!

What if a voter has moved? These situations can be tricky, so please do not hesitate to call Voter Registration staff in the Office of Elections if you are unsure of what to do.

This image is of the Moving Conditions chart from the "What-Ifs" section in the Chiefs Notebook. You will need to consult this anytime you have a voter who has moved and their current residential address does not match their registered address on the Poll Pad.

First, ask the voter, "When did you move?"

Then, determine how far the voter moved.

At the intersection of these two answers, the chart will guide you to a specific section of the "What-Ifs" which will give you detailed instructions on moving forward. This chart can be a bit confusing so you should familiarize yourself with it before election day. If you do have questions on election day, don't hesitate to call Voter Registration staff in the Office of Elections.

What if a voter is marked as Inactive on the pollbook?

Voters can become inactive if they do not respond to a confirmation mailing or if they moved and did not update their voter registration. If the voter has moved, you need to go to the "What-Ifs" section of the Notebook.

If the Inactive voter has not moved, then they need to fill out the "Affirmation of Eligibility" form. For this situation, you can disregard the "Statement of Challenger" part of the form.

Once the form is completed, check in the voter on the Poll Pad (remember to select the "Voter Signed Oath" flag.)

What if a voter needs assistance?

Some voters need help reading, translating, or marking the ballot. Sometimes, they will come with a person who will assist them. Others may need an Election Officer to assist them.

A voter and their assistant must complete the Request for Assistance form. Once this form is completed and returned to the Chief, the voter's assistant can provide any help with the ballot.

(The only exception is children who are age 15 or younger. They may assist without filling out the form.)

Please remember that if an Election Officer assists a voter, they should still try to maintain the 6-feet of social distancing. We know this will be difficult but it's very important.

What if a voter wants to vote curbside?

Voters who are over 65 or disabled are eligible to vote outside the polls. Do not question any voter's eligibility to vote curbside.

The voter will call the curbside number displayed on the large yellow A-frame sandwich sign. Two election officers should go out to the curb and assist them. (Do not take Poll Pads outside.)

No form is required for someone to be able to vote curbside. However, some curbside voters may need assistance so election officers should take a Request for Assistance form with them.

Make sure to check the "Outside Polls" flag on the Poll Pad for any curbside voters.

What if a Poll Pad indicates that a voter requested an absentee ballot?

If a voter has the completed absentee ballot envelope, first remind them they have the option of depositing it in the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box.

If a voter has an absentee ballot but wants to vote in-person, they can choose to surrender their ballot. In this case, ask the voter to hand it to you, write ABSENTEE SPOILED on it, process the voter on the Poll Pad, and then give the voter a new ballot to vote in-person.

If the voter does not have the absentee ballot with them, they must vote provisionally.

If the voter needs to vote provisionally, provide them with a Provisional Vote Envelope, Provisional Voter Notice, and a ballot.

Remember - it is critical that the envelope is filled out completely and the voter and the Election Officer both sign the Provisional Ballot Envelope.

section: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS"

The Electoral Board and only the Electoral Board decides whether a provisional ballot is counted.

Some voters may ask you if their provisional vote will be counted. You cannot tell them one way or the other since the Electoral Board always makes the final decision.

Hi, my name is Sushila Arur and I work on the Election Officer team.

I'm going to take you through the Closing Procedures. We're in the home stretch now!

When closing procedures begin (at 7:00 PM or after the last voter in line has voted), the Absentee Ballot Collector officers should be outside the voting room with the Drop-Off Box.

They will remove and count the absentee ballot envelopes, then secure them in a large manila envelope.

On the front of the envelope, they will tape a pink sheet that indicates how many absentee ballot envelopes are inside.

On the back of the envelope, they will secure it with red tamper tape and then apply a signature seal.

They should then disassemble the Drop-Off Box and pack it in the cardboard box again.

We will provide Chiefs, Assistant Chiefs, and Absentee Ballot Collector officers with more detailed instructions by email before election day.

Before you or your Election Officers close the DS200 and begin completing the election forms, you must check the Auxiliary Compartment to make sure it's empty, even if you don't think you used it during the day.

If there are any ballots inside the Auxiliary Compartment, remove them and insert them into the scanner. If any ballot cannot be scanned, you will have to hand-count them.

Once you have closed down and unplugged the DS200 and the ExpressVote machines, you will need to remove the USB flash drives. You must remove all media sticks from all machines, whether you used them for voting or not.

Each DS200 contains 1 main USB flash drive and 1 backup USB flash drive. Return these in the purple pouch.

Each ExpressVote contains just 1 USB flash drive. Return these in the orange #7 pouch.

Remember that the Absentee Ballot Collectors are waiting to take custody of the sealed Purple Pouch containing election media from the DS200 machines.

During closing, your first priority should be to shut down the DS200 scanners and remove the USB flash drives as soon as possible.

Ensure that the Purple Pouch contains 4 USB flash drives (2 from each DS200) before sealing it.

Once it is sealed, give the Purple Pouch to the Absentee Ballot Collectors through a doorway.

As soon as the Absentee Ballot Collectors have the absentee ballots and the purple pouch, they should leave immediately to drive to the Fairfax County Government Center. This should be no later than 7:30 PM.

Absentee Ballot Collectors will not sign the SOR or other closing documents.

Absentee Ballot Collector officers are encouraged to drive together in the same car, if possible (especially if vaccinated). But if they prefer, they may drive separately.

After the DS200 tape prints, you will need to cut it in certain places and attach them to the appropriate document. There is a handout in the back of your Chiefs Notebook that provides some extra guidance on how to do this.

Follow the instructions in Section 8 of the Chief's Notebook to complete your Statement of Results (SOR).

You should complete the back page, with the candidate totals, first. This way, you can call in your results as soon as possible. A lot of people are waiting to find out who won!

IMPORTANT: All election officers should focus on closing the polls. Do not let anyone get distracted with speculating about which candidates may be ahead or will win.

As soon as you complete the SOR candidate totals sections, you should copy the information over to your call sheets.

You should have two call sheets: a **buff** color one that you will post at the precinct and a **blue one** that the Chiefs will drive back on election night.

As soon as you've filled out your call sheets, call in your results.

If you are not able to call in your results by 8:00 PM, you should call your Rover so they may help you if needed.

Use the tab seals for the pouches.

Be careful inserting the seal, it breaks easily. If you break the tab seal, use backup zip-tie seals.

There are a number of documents that require signatures from the Chief, Assistant Chief, and all Election Officers.

For all documents, the Chief should always sign in position 1, the Assistant Chief should sign in position 2, and the two Absentee Ballot Collector officers should sign in positions 3 and 4. All other election officers may sign in the remaining positions. Please try to have all officers sign in the same spot on each form (e.g. the officer who signs in position 5 on the Oath should sign on position 5 on all other forms).

Before you finish packing everything, use the Required Signature Checklist in the Chiefs Notebook to ensure that all officers have signed all required documents. If any required document is missing an Officer's signature, we will call the Election Officer whose signature is missing and they will have to come to the Office of Elections within 2 days to sign them. It's much better to make sure everything is signed on Election Day than to have to come to our office! But you should never have your officers pre-sign forms and labels during the day.
