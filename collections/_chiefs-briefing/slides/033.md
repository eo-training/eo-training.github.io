This is the Demonstration Ballot with a generic Mount Rushmore election. You can use it to point and show voters how to fill in the circles on the ballot.

**Do not use** the real sample ballot to do this. If you point at circles or candidates on the real sample ballot, voters will think you are trying to encourage them to vote for that candidate.
