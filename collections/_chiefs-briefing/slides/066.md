What if a Poll Pad indicates that a voter requested an absentee ballot?

If a voter has the completed absentee ballot envelope, first remind them they have the option of depositing it in the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box.

If a voter has an absentee ballot but wants to vote in-person, they can choose to surrender their ballot. In this case, ask the voter to hand it to you, write ABSENTEE SPOILED on it, process the voter on the Poll Pad, and then give the voter a new ballot to vote in-person.

If the voter does not have the absentee ballot with them, they must vote provisionally.
