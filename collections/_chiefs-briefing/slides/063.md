What if a voter is marked as Inactive on the pollbook?

Voters can become inactive if they do not respond to a confirmation mailing or if they moved and did not update their voter registration. If the voter has moved, you need to go to the "What-Ifs" section of the Notebook.

If the Inactive voter has not moved, then they need to fill out the "Affirmation of Eligibility" form. For this situation, you can disregard the "Statement of Challenger" part of the form.

Once the form is completed, check in the voter on the Poll Pad (remember to select the "Voter Signed Oath" flag.)
