Ensure 6 feet of distance between any voters waiting to use the voting machine.

Tear off 10 "I Voted" stickers at a time and place them on a table so voters can pick them up on their own.

Do **NOT** use the spray disinfectant to clean voting machines. Use **alcohol wipes** if the surface needs to be cleaned.
