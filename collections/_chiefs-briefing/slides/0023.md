Let's go over the Drop-Off Box in more detail.

**Location of the Drop-Off Box:** You should locate the Drop-Off Box outside of your voting room, away from the line of voters, near the entrance to the voting room in an area that is visible to voters.

**Hours of Operation:** The Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box must be set up by 6:00 a.m. and available for voters between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on Election Day. Any voters in line at the Drop-Off Box at 7:00 p.m. must also be permitted to place their voted absentee ballots in the Drop-Off Box.

**Security:** The Chief will designate an Election Officer to monitor the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Election Day. Another officer may relieve the officer who is monitoring the Drop-Off Box, but you must ensure that the first officer does not leave until their replacement arrives, so the Drop-Off Box is never unattended.

**Curbside Voters:** Curbside voters may return voted absentee ballot envelopes. The two officers who assist the curbside voter will place the absentee ballot envelope in a green folder, take it inside, and deposit the voted absentee ballot envelope in the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box.
