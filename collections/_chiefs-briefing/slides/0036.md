Ensure Election Officers are wearing a face mask or a face shield while in the voting room. We encourage all election officers to wear a face mask, if possible. However, if an election officer says they cannot wear a face mask (e.g. for a medical reason), they are permitted to wear a face shield. You should not question someone's reason for preferring to wear a face shield.

Election Officers may choose to bring and wear their own face covering, but our office will provide enough face masks and face shields for all officers.

Help ensure Election Officers wear face coverings properly (e.g. always covering nose and mouth, not pulled down to talk, etc.).

Ensure Election Officers wear gloves in the voting room when at stations requiring interaction with voters (e.g. at the Check-In Tables and Ballot Table).
