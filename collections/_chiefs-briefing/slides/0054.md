Please make sure you have all the supplies. Try to keep the papers in the kit in the same order so they will be easier to find. There will be no **I VOTED** stickers this election. Remember you have blue handout sheets at the end of your notebook to give to your officers to help them pack up supplies at the end of the evening.
