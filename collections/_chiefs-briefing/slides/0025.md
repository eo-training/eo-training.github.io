**Absentee Ballot Collectors**

We have assigned two Officers, representing different political parties, as Absentee Ballot Collectors. At 7:00 p.m., these Officers are required to count and secure the absentee ballots that were deposited in the Absentee Ballot Drop-off Box. The Absentee Ballot Collectors are also required to count and secure the absentee ballots from the Drop-off Box during the day if it gets full.

**Closing Procedures**

The Absentee Ballot Collectors must be stationed at the Drop-Off Box at 7:00 p.m. After any voter present at 7:00 p.m. has placed their voted absentee ballot in the Drop-Off Box, these Officers will open the Drop-Off Box and count the number of voted absentee ballot envelopes. After counting the voted absentee ballot envelopes, the Absentee Ballot Collectors will place the ballots in a white cardboard box that the Chief received when they picked up their supplies. The Absentee Ballot Collectors will then place seals on the white box with the name of the precinct, the date, the number of absentee ballot envelopes, and their signatures. They will also complete and sign a Transfer Sheet. After sealing the box and completing the Transfer Sheet, they will take the boxes of absentee ballots and the Transfer Sheet to Room 339 in Government Center at 12000 Government Center Parkway.
