Each polling place will receive 3 to 6 Poll Pads and you should set up one Poll Pad for the Chief and set up all other Poll Pads at check-in stations if possible.

Each polling place will receive 15 voting booths. You should set up all voting booths if possible. This is necessary because it takes voters longer to vote the long ballot. Remember to space the voting booth at least 6-feet apart.

Each polling place will also receive two or three DS200 scanners and two ExpressVote machines. Please set up all of your DS200 voting machines so they will be ready for voters to use them.

Please set up one ExpressVote machine and keep the second ExpressVote machine as a backup.
