title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS: What if a voter has no acceptable ID?"
---

The first non-routine situation is if a voter does not have an ID when they come to the polling location. There are three alternatives for the voter.

- As of July 2020, the voter can now complete the new ID Confirmation Statement. If the voter completes this statement, they are eligible to vote normally.

- The voter can vote provisionally and provide the Office of Elections with an acceptable ID by 12:00 p.m. on the third day after the election.

- The voter can retrieve their ID from their car or home. But please do not tell them they _must_ retrieve the ID to vote. This is not accurate. They are still eligible to vote with an ID Confirmation Statement or a Provisional Ballot.
