This is the Election Officer Evaluation Form. We ask that you complete this form for each of your officers to provide us with the feedback we need to be able to assign the best possible team to each precinct in future elections.

If you have any officers who are truly excellent, or any officers who need significant improvement, please make sure to add written comments to help us understand why. We review these very carefully after each election.

We strongly encourage you to complete all evaluations by 5:00 PM on election day, so it doesn't distract you from closing the polls.
