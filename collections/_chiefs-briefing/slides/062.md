What if a voter has moved? These situations can be tricky, so please do not hesitate to call Voter Registration staff in the Office of Elections if you are unsure of what to do.

This image is of the Moving Conditions chart from the "What-Ifs" section in the Chiefs Notebook. You will need to consult this anytime you have a voter who has moved and their current residential address does not match their registered address on the Poll Pad.

First, ask the voter, "When did you move?"

Then, determine how far the voter moved.

At the intersection of these two answers, the chart will guide you to a specific section of the "What-Ifs" which will give you detailed instructions on moving forward. This chart can be a bit confusing so you should familiarize yourself with it before election day. If you do have questions on election day, don't hesitate to call Voter Registration staff in the Office of Elections.
