In your supplies, you will receive 2 large manila envelopes for securing voted absentee ballots.

Give one envelope to the Absentee Ballot Collector officers, who will use it to secure any voted absentee ballots from the drop-off box.

If they do not need the second envelope, return it with your other materials.
