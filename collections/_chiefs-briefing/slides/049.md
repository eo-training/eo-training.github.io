Two election officers will assist curbside voters.

**Do not question any voter's right to vote curbside.**

Ask the voter to only partially roll down their window.

Approach the voter from the passenger side door of their car to maintain social distancing.

Handle only one voter at a time and follow our normal curbside procedures.
