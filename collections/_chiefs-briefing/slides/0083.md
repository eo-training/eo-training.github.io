This is an example of the ID Confirmation statement. As you can see, it's a quick form to fill out!

First, the Chief, Assistant Chief, or Non-Routine Specialist fills in the precinct number and name, the date, and their initials.

Next, give the form to the voter, who signs and prints their name and writes the date. They may also add their birth year and last 4 digits of their social security number.

Lastly, check in the voter on the Poll Pad and select the "Voter Signed Oath" flag.

In following this procedure, a voter would be allowed to vote normally. That means you would issue them a regular ballot, they would mark it at the polling place, and they would deposit it in a DS200 ballot scanner.
