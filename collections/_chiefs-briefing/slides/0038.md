Place an extra table in front of the check-in tables and Chief's table to maintain 6-feet of social distancing between voters and Election Officers. In addition, make sure that you maintain 6-feet of social distancing between all individuals in the voting room.

Use blue painter's tape to mark a rectangle on the Check-in table. Place a box lid from a box of privacy folders inside the rectangle. Direct voters to place their ID in the box lid on the check-in table.

Slide the box lid back and forth through the opening in the sneeze guard to maintain social distancing.
