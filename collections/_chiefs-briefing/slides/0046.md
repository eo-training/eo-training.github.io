All Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs must pickup essential election supplies the week before election day.

Everyone will receive a Chiefs Notebook and election supply envelope at your Supply Pickup time.

Usually, the Chief in each precinct receives just a black rolling kit. This election, the Chief will receive many more materials:

- Black rolling kit
- 4 to 5 cardboard boxes of PPE materials
- 4 large Zip-Loc bags of PPE materials
- Flat unassembled white cardboard boxes (for securing absentee ballots from the Drop-Off Box)

If you are the Chief, please make sure you have enough space in your car to take all of these materials with you. We will have a staff member take them to your car and load them inside.
