In the "Handouts" section of your Chiefs Notebook, we provide salmon-colored position description pages. You should remove these from your Notebook and place them near each station in the voting room.

Election officers will rotate among the following duties during election day:

- **Voter Information Officer**: Greet voters, answer questions
- **Pollbook Officer**: Check in voters on Poll Pad
- **Ballot Officer**: Issue ballots to voters
- **Voting Booth Officer**: Instruct voters at voting booths
- **Voting Machine Officer**: Instruct voters at DS200 scanner
- **Drop-Off Box Officer**: Monitor the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box

Note that the Drop-Off Box Officer is the individual who will monitor the Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. You can rotate this position and have different officers perform this function throughout the day. This position is different from the two Absentee Ballot Collectors, who are responsible for counting and securing absentee ballots at 7:00 p.m. and taking them to the Fairfax County Government Center.
