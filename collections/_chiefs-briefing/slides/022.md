Now, let's jump forward to the day before the election! What do you do?

First, the Chief will receive the Sheriff's Envelope. This envelope contains last-minute materials, including the iSync drive with the final list of registered and absentee voters. If you are the Chief, you do not have to be home; the Sheriffs will post it at your front door. If you do not receive it by 3:00 PM, let us know immediately so we can arrange for a backup to be delivered to you.

In addition, all available officers should help setup the polling place. (You must first confirm the setup day and time with your polling place â€“ don't just show up!)
