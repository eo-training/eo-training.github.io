**NON-ROUTINE SPECIALIST**

- Each polling place will have a Non-Routine Voting Specialist to assist with non-routine voters. This individual will not be a manager, will not make any decisions concerning provisional voters or moving conditions, and will not take the place of the Chief or Assistant Chief in any way.

**ELECTION PAGES**

- Election Pages will be used at many polling places for this election. Pages can help greet voters, manage lines, and direct voters to the Absentee Ballot Drop-off Box if the voter is just dropping off a voted absentee ballot.
- Important Reminder: Just like Election Officers, Pages are required to wear a face mask and/or a face shield and they are required to stay at least 6-feet away from voters, Election Officers, and anyone else in the polling place.
