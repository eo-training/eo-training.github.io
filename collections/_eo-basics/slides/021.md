This is the **Machine Certification Form**. As you open and close your DS200s on election day, you will need to use this form.

During opening procedures, election officers will compare the pre-printed seal and counter numbers in the green table to those on the DS200 to ensure they match. If the numbers do not match, stop and notify your Chief, who will contact our office for next steps.
