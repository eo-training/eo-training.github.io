All election officers must sign two documents during Opening Procedures.

- **OATH:** After the Chief swears you in at 5:00 AM, sign the Oath form. Remember which numbered line you signed on - this will be where you sign on all required documents throughout the day. For example, if you signed in as officer #7, you should sign on line #7 for the Compensation Sheet, Statement of Results, and other documents.
- **COMPENSATION SHEET:** During Opening Procedures or at the earliest feasible time, fill out and sign the Compensation Sheet. Without this, we cannot pay you! And remember to sign on the same numbered row as you did on the Oath form (e.g. as officer #7).
