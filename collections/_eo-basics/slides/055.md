Sometimes, a voter does not complete the process of voting. If a voter leaves their ballot in the polling place, they are a FLEEING VOTER.

If the voter left the ballot on the DS200 scanner, you may cast it for them. If it will not scan, the ballot should be put in the DS200 scanner's auxiliary compartment and hand-counted at the end of the day.

Otherwise, if the voter left the ballot anywhere else in the polling place, such as in a voting booth, call for the Chief. They will write VOID in large letters across the face of the ballot and must return it with other election materials at the end of the day.
