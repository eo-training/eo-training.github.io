These are the 3 types of voting equipment we just mentioned. We will go into more detail about each type of voting equipment later in this training, but here's a quick rundown:

- **POLL PAD:** This is an iPad-based tablet device used to check in each voter. It is also sometimes called an electronic pollbook.
- **EXPRESSVOTE:** This is a ballot marking device. It's like a big pen! It prints a marked ballot card that voters can then scan themselves. This ADA-complaint device is especially helpful for voters who are visually impaired or have difficulty marking a regular ballot. However, any voter may choose to use the ExpressVote.
- **DS200 SCANNER:** This is the device voters use to cast their ballot. Once a ballot is inserted, the DS200 automatically scans and counts the votes.
