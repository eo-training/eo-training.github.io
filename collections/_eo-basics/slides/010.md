Outside the polling place, there is a **40-foot Prohibited Area**, which provides voters unimpeded access to the building.

State law prohibits loitering, congregating, or electioneering within 40 feet of a polling place entrance (i.e. the building entrance, NOT the voting room entrance). Restricted activities include, but are not limited to, **campaigning, handing out flyers,** and **bake sales**.

These activities are permitted outside of the 40-foot Prohibited Area.
