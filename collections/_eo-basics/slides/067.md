Congratulations! You have now completed this online class.

To receive credit, you must still take and pass the quiz. You can find the quiz in the Election Officer Portal. Go to the Training tab, scroll down, and look in the bottom-right for a link labeled "Take Quiz." If you do not pass the quiz the first time, you can take it again. You can have the training materials open to reference as you take the quiz.

1. If you need help or to contact us anytime, email ElectionOfficers@fairfaxcounty.gov or call 703-324-4735.
2. For upcoming election information, visit our agency website.
3. As always, you can use the Election Officer Portal to indicate your availability each election, enroll in training, and check your precinct assignment.
4. For more training resources, you can find all classes, videos, and handouts on our training website.

This training is now complete. Thank you and we know you'll do great on election day!
