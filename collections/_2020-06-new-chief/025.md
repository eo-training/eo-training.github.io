title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS, PART 2: What if...voter has no ID?"
---

If a voter does not have an acceptable ID with them, they still have multiple options to vote.

-   The voter can retrieve their ID, if it's simply in their car or at home, or the voter can get a temporary ID from the Office of Elections.
-   However, you should always offer the voter a provisional ballot. Many voters say they will return, but they don't!

Provisional ballots are ballots that are set aside on election day and adjudicated later. There is a common misconception that provisional ballots are only counted in close races or to break ties; this is not true! Provisional ballots are reviewed by the Electoral Board in the days after the election and, if counted, they are included in the official election results.
