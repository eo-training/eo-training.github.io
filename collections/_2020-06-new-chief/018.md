title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS, PART 1: What if...voter is Inactive?"
---

Voters can become "Inactive" if:

-   They have moved, but did not update their voter registration.
-   Or, if they have not voted in two consecutive federal elections, which occur in even-numbered years. For example, if someone did not vote in 2016 or 2018, they may now be marked as inactive.

How do you process an Inactive voter?

1.  First, ask the voter if they have moved. If the answer is yes, stop and use the Moving Conditions in the What-Ifs.
2.  Otherwise, simply ask the voter complete an Affirmation of Eligibility form. Now the voter can be checked-in.
3.  On the Poll Pad, select the *Voter Signed Oath* flag.

That's it! One form and one flag on the Poll Pad. There's no need to call the office for Inactive voters, but you can if you'd like help the first time.
