Congratulations! You have now completed the online class for New Chiefs & Assistant Chiefs.

To receive credit for this class, you must still take and pass the quiz. You can find the quiz in the [Election Officer Portal](https://www.vote4fairfax.com). Login, go to the Training tab, scroll down, and look in the bottom-right for a link labeled &quot;Quiz&quot;. If you do not pass the quiz the first time, you can take it again until you pass.
