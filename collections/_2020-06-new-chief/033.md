title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS, PART 2: Moving situation (moved to Maryland)"
---

Let's take a look at an example situation. What if a voter moved in July 2018 to Maryland?

-   First, we look for the row that matches the moving date. July 2018 is between 11/9/2016 and 11/5/2019, so we are looking in the middle row.
-   Next, we look for the column that matches how far the voter moved. In this case, they moved to another state, which is the rightmost column.
-   Therefore, we can see that "No", they cannot vote routinely. But again, you should always offer a provisional ballot to the voter.

As you can see on the chart, no matter when a voter moves out-of-state (even if it was the day before the election), they are not eligible to vote routinely in Virginia anymore.
