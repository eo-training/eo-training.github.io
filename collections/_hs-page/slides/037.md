This is what the Poll Pad looks like. It is a state-of-the art, electronic pollbook. It is easy to set up with no peripherals. It looks up voters electronically when they check in to their precinct. Because it processes voters in seconds, it reduces wait time. It also provides precinct statistics for accurate reporting.

While you cannot operate the Poll Pad and check-in voters, you make be asked to help set it up in the morning or pack it up after the polls close.
