Other people you might see on Election Day are candidates (campaigning outside the 40-ft prohibited area);

Authorized poll watchers – these are individuals who have permission from their political party or independent candidate to be inside the polling place to observe; 

Poll workers – this is anyone working outside the 40-ft prohibited area…passing out sample ballots, candidate information, collecting signatures for petitions, even exit polling.

Press – news media are allowed to come inside and film or photograph for a limited amount of time.  They cannot interview anyone inside the polling place. They cannot film or photograph in any way that shows how a person votes their ballot.  Remember, the voter must be able to vote privately and cast a secret ballot.

And finally, authorized visitors.  These are usually delegation from other countries that want to observe the process and have received permission from the Electoral Board.
