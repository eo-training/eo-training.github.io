This may include personal protective equipment or PPE. PPE includes masks, gloves, cleaning supplies, face shields. The Chief may ask you to help mark 6-ft spots to help voters maintain social distance while they wait in line to vote.

You may be asked to count unmarked ballots; or maybe to help arrange the placement of the voting machines and privacy booths used to mark the ballots.

Additionally, you may be tasked with making sure that the path that voters will follow from the parking lot into the building and to the voting room is clear from any obstruction or hazard that may cause problems for people with wheelchairs, canes, or walkers. Fairfax County polling places must be accessible to ALL voters.
