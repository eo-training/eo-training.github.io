This is the prohibited area sign that will also be posted outside. According to law, no activity such as loitering; attempting to influence a voter in any way; or hindering an election officer, is permitted within 40-ft of the entrance to the polling place. This not only includes campaigning but non-political activity like bake sales, or spirit-wear sales, even a band playing to raise money for their school.

Certain activity is also not permitted beyond the 40-ft prohibited area, such as using loud speakers within 300 yards; hindering or intimidating voters; or insulting or abusing an election officer.

Part of the election materials is a yellow plastic rope that measures 40 feet. The morning pages may be asked to help mark the prohibited area before the polls open. The Chief may ask pages to check the prohibited area throughout the day to make sure that nothing is violating the 40-ft requirement.
