Most people when asked how old someone needs to be to vote would answer, "18." This is correct, however the law allows you to register to vote if you are a U.S. citizen and you will be 18 on or before Election Day. So if you are 17 now but will be 18 on or before November 2, 2021, you can register. Use the link www.vote.virginia.gov and have your Virginia driver’s license or identification card handy. You will need to provide the ID number on it to register. 

Did you know that if you are 18 and registered to vote, you can serve as an election officer and earn $175?  If you would like to be an election officer, please visit https://www.vote4fairfax.com/ to apply.
