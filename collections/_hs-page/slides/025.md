This is an example of the paper ballot that is marked by the voter.  The ballot will include English, Korean, Vietnamese, and Spanish. If a voter messes up or wants to change how they voted in a contest, their ballot must be marked "Spoiled" and returned to the ballot table before the voter can be issued a new one.
