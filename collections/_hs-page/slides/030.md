There are a few things that you cannot do, primarily because student pages are not election officers.  This includes opening and closing the Poll Pads; checking voters in on Poll Pads; supervising the use of the voting machines.  You cannot leave the polling place without permission. This is a service-learning project, it is a volunteer activity and you will not be compensated for your service.
