Hello and welcome to the online training session for the Fairfax County Page Program. My name is Beth Dixon Methfessel, the coordinator of the Page Program in Fairfax County. This service-learning project is designed for the motivated high school student (at least 16 years old) who wants to learn more about the electoral process.

Due to the health crisis caused by COVID-19, you must receive permission from your parent/guardian to participate as an election page. You will be assigned to a Fairfax County polling place and as such, you will be required to wear a mask at all times when you are in the voting room. You will also follow all health protocols while serving as a student page.

Election Day is Tuesday, November 3. Although you will have been virtual learning, there will be no school on Election Day.
