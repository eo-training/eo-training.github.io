After your shift, your Chief will complete an evaluation that will confirm how many hours you served.  If you complete your shift, you will receive a Certificate of Recognition from the Office of Elections, as well as credit for 9 hours of service learning, 1 hour for training and 8 hours at your polling place. You may also submit a service hour confirmation through x2vol either to your Chief or to my attention, beth.methfessel@fairfaxcounty.gov
