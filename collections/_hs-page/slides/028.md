This is a data collection activity especially suited for student pages.  It’s the Line Length Survey.  Every hour you will count how many people are waiting in line to check in.  Morning pages will do 6 a.m. until noon and afternoon pages will do 1:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.  Pretty simple and straightforward, but a very important task because the results will be provided to CalTech/MIT’s ongoing voting technology project "Polling Processes of the Future."  The recommendations from the project are used to refine and develop new, practical tools to help us better allocate resources dedicated to voting.  Fairfax County continues to provide annual comprehensive line length data for this project.  This distinction would not be possible without the participation of our high school election pages.
