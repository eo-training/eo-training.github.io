The training will be divided into three sessions and should take about an hour to complete. You will be taking a test prior to completing your application to ensure that you understand all the material that has been discussed. Only after you have completed training and passed the test will your application be considered. If you do not achieve 80%, we will contact you.

The link to the test will be provided at the end of training.
