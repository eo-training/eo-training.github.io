Relax when talking with someone with a disability. Just treat the person the same as you would anyone else, and don’t be embarrassed if someone with a disability corrects your etiquette. 

Don’t make assumptions or decisions on what a person with a disability can or cannot do. If the person needs assistance, they will ask.
