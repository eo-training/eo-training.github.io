Those who choose the 5 a.m. â€“ 1 p.m.  (morning) shift will help open the polls. Please make sure that you have checked the directions to your polling place.  It will be dark at 5 a.m. so things will look different, and we do not want you to get lost. If that happens or you are running late, you need to contact your Chief Election Officer.  We will discuss who the Chief is a bit later in the training.
