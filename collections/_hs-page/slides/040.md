The DS200 sits on top of a ballot bin. The bin has wheels to make it easy to move. After the ballots are scanned, they drop down into this secured bin.  Once voting ends, the bin is opened. The ballots are retrieved and placed into boxes that are then labeled and sealed with security tape.  After the election, all ballots, voted or unused, will be taken to the Fairfax County Courthouse and stored for two years.
