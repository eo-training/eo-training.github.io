What if someone shows up to vote, but they are not registered in your precinct?

- Inform them that Virginia law states that they must vote in their registered precinct for their vote to count.

- You should strongly encourage them to go to the correct precinct. Again, Virginia law states that you must vote in your registered precinct on election day for your vote to count.

- Of course, all voters have the option of voting a provisional ballot. If an out-of-precinct voter chooses to vote a provisional ballot, make sure they first understand they are not voting in their registered precinct. All provisional ballots are adjudicated by the Electoral Board, who follow the law in determining which ballots to count.
