What should you do if a voter is already listed in the pollbook as having voted earlier in the day?

- This may have happened if one of your officers checked in someone manually with the wrong name. For example, **Bob Voter, Jr.** arrived to vote, but was checked-in as **Bob Voter**.
- Unless both voters are present, do NOT edit the previous check-in.
- Instead, offer the voter a provisional ballot.

The Electoral Board will review the situation and determine if the ballot should be counted.
