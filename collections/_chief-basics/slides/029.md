Some voters may be listed in the pollbook with a P.O. Box instead of a typical address. That's OK!

- During the check-in process, as long as the address the voter provides orally or in writing matches the address listed in the Poll Pad, you should check them in routinely.
- Individuals registered with a P.O. Box are known as **Protected Voters**. They may be law enforcement personnel or other individuals who need to keep their residential address private.
- To be clear, you do NOT need a provisional ballot.

Again, as long as the voter provides the same address as in the pollbook, you should always check-in the voter routinely. There is no need to call the office for this situation.
