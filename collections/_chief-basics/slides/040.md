This is a sample of the Provisional Ballot Log.

For each provisional voter, you will record some basic information about them here, including their name, address, year of birth, and phone number. The voter writes this information on the individual provisional envelopes, so you can simply copy it over.

You must also select a numerical reason code for each provisional voter - these are listed at the bottom of the page and on the individual provisional envelopes. (There is a helpful explanation of what each code means on page 20 of the What-Ifs.)

Leave the two rightmost columns blank - those are reserved for the Electoral Board.
