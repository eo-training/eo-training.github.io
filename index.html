<p>From time to time, you may also see CAP materials below. These are for the officers working in the Central Absentee Precinct who work in the Fairfax County Government Center on election day and process mailed absentee ballots. You should only review these materials if you have specifically been assigned to work in the Central Absentee Precinct (this is about 50 officers out of 2,500 each election).</p>
