# Operational and Procedural Updates June 2022

This page summarizes changes in procedures for the June 2022 Democratic Party Primary.

**Officers Per Precinct**

Each precinct has been assigned 5-7 election officers, including the Chief, Assistant Chief, and any Collector Officers and Language Officers.

Some co-located precincts will not be assigned Collector Officers and will work with the other precinct in their building to return their absentee ballot envelopes, DS200 flash drives, and the election night numbers form.

**COVID-19**

We continue working with county staff, health professionals, and the Virginia Department of Elections to refine our COVID-19 measures. At this time, there is no face mask or social distancing requirement. Election officers may choose to wear a mask but are not required to do so.

We will provide each precinct with:

- Sneeze guards
- A box of face masks
- Hand sanitizer
- Disinfectant wipes

The sneeze guards should be set up at the check-in table, ballot table, and Chief&#39;s table where practicable. The masks, sanitizer, and wipes are available to you and voters as needed. You may recirculate pens and privacy folders.

**Ballots**

Each precinct will receive ballots for at least 25% of active registered voters.

Ballots packaged in shrink-wrapped packs of 100 will be delivered to precincts in the gray cart. Ballots are no longer padded or stubbed. Election officers must count opened packs of ballots before issuing them to voters.

**Poll Pads**

We have purchased and issued new Poll Pads to all precincts. You will notice that they now come in individual cases along with the base, ID holder, and charger. During the day, the only difference you will notice is the speed of the device!

The software is the same and the process of checking in a voter remains unchanged.

At the end of the day, you should not power off the Poll Pads. Keep the devices on with the home screen of the Poll Pad app pulled up and place them back in their case. This ensures that office staff can quickly import all voter check-ins after voting ends. Make sure to return each Poll Pad to its original case.

**Voting Equipment**

You should only set up one ExpressVote and one DS200 scanner on election day. Be prepared to set up your backup, if needed. If you power on your second DS200, you must follow the full closing procedures after polls close on both scanners, including printing out all tapes, even if no ballots were scanned.

Note that an officer must remove 2 flash drives from both DS200s, even if one was not opened.

**New Forms**

- Precinct Data Sheet: Throughout the day, an officer will use this form to ensure the number of check-ins matches the number of ballots cast throughout the day. You will also record the number of ballots in each pack you open on this sheet.
- Election Night Numbers Sheet: During closing procedures, an officer will use this form to record the number of provisional voters and curbside voters. We must submit these numbers to the Virginia Department of Elections on election night. Instead of having precincts call in these numbers as we have in the past, Collector Officers will return this form to the Fairfax County Government Center.
- Precinct Results Notice: During closing procedures, an officer will use this form to post results at the entrance of your polling place. Instead of transcribing the results onto a separate form, you will attach opening and closing tapes from the DS200 to this form and post it at the door.
