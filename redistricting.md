## Fairfax County Redistricting

**Overview**

As a result of the decennial U.S. Census and subsequent adoption of new congressional district, Senate district, and House of Delegate District lines as drawn by the special masters for the Supreme Court of Virginia, local governing bodies were [required](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter3/section24.2-307/) to eliminate any resulting split precincts. Each precinct must now be wholly contained within a single congressional, state senate, delegate, and magisterial district.

**Impact**

Fairfax County now has 264 voting precincts, an increase from 247. The 264 precincts will be located in 230 polling places across the county, a slight increase from 229.

Although more than 100 precincts were impacted by required changes imposed by the new state district lines, we were able to keep 96.2% of voters assigned to their current polling place. 

You can check your voting precinct and polling place [here](https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/Lookup/polling).

All changes will be in effect for the June 2022 Primary. As an election officer, you may be assigned to a new precinct. You may even be part of the very first election officer team to serve in a new precinct if you are serving in the June 2022 Primary or November 2022 General Election!


### Precinct Changes

As a result of required changes to precinct boundaries, we eliminated 10 precincts. Many of these precincts were merged with a neighboring precinct that already used the same polling place.

**10 eliminated precincts:**

- 133 DANBURY *(absorbed into 108 KINGS PARK)*
- 333 SALONA #2 *(absorbed into 316 SALONA)*
- 430 LANE #2 *(absorbed into 419 LANE)*
- 531 BAILEYS #2 *(absorbed into 501 BAILEYS)*
- 532 WEYANOKE #2 *(absorbed into 516 WEYANOKE)*
- 534 CAMELOT #2 *(absorbed into 522 CAMELOT)*
- 619 BELVOIR *(absorbed into 630 ARMY)*
- 930 LEES CORNER *(absorbed into 905 FRANKLIN and 934 FOX VALLEY)*
- 932 STONE SOUTH *(absorbed into 917 STONE)*
- 933 COMPTON *(absorbed into 854 NEWGATE SOUTH)*

We were required to create 27 new precincts to accommodate the new state lines. Many of these precincts have a new name, but will continue to use the same polling place.
