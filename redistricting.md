## Fairfax County Redistricting

**Overview**

As a result of the 2020 U.S. Census and subsequent adoption of new congressional district, Senate district, and House of Delegate District lines as drawn by the special masters for the Supreme Court of Virginia, local governing bodies were [required](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter3/section24.2-307/#:~:text=Requirements%20for%20county%20and%20city%20precincts.,precincts%20as%20it%20deems%20necessary) to eliminate any resulting split precincts. Each precinct must now be wholly contained within a single congressional, state senate, delegate, and magisterial district.

**Impact**

Fairfax County now has 264 voting precincts, an increase from 247. The 264 precincts will be located in 230 polling places across the county, a slight increase from 229.

Although more than 100 precincts were impacted by required changes imposed by the new state district lines, we were able to keep 96.2% of voters assigned to their current polling place. 

You can check your voting precinct and polling place [here](https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/Lookup/polling).

All changes will be in effect for the June 2022 Primary. As an election officer, you may be assigned to a new precinct. You may even be part of the very first election officer team to serve in a new precinct if you are serving in the June 2022 Primary or November 2022 General Election!


### Precinct Changes

As a result of required changes to precinct boundaries, we eliminated 10 precincts. Many of these precincts were merged with a neighboring precinct that already used the same polling place.

**10 eliminated precincts:**

- 133 DANBURY *(absorbed into 108 KINGS PARK)*
- 333 SALONA #2 *(absorbed into 316 SALONA)*
- 430 LANE #2 *(absorbed into 419 LANE)*
- 531 BAILEYS #2 *(absorbed into 501 BAILEYS)*
- 532 WEYANOKE #2 *(absorbed into 516 WEYANOKE)*
- 534 CAMELOT #2 *(absorbed into 522 CAMELOT)*
- 619 BELVOIR *(absorbed into 630 ARMY)*
- 930 LEES CORNER *(absorbed into 905 FRANKLIN and 934 FOX VALLEY)*
- 932 STONE SOUTH *(absorbed into 917 STONE)*
- 933 COMPTON *(absorbed into 854 NEWGATE SOUTH)*

We were required to create 27 new precincts to accommodate the new state lines. Many of these precincts have a new name, but will continue to use the same polling place.

These changes were presented at the March 8th, 2022 Board of Supervisors meeting, and since have been approved by the Board of Supervisors and the Virginia Attorney General.

### Complete list of precincts

See below for a list of all 264 precincts, including their Congressional district, magisterial district, number of active registered voters, polling place, and any co-located precincts at the same polling place.

We now have a total of 67 co-located precincts (32 polling places with two precincts each, 1 polling place with three precincts), about double from the previous year.

There are now 82 precincts in the 8th Congressional District, 8 precincts in the 10th Congressional District, and 174 precincts in the 11th Congressional District. **For the June 2022 Democratic Primary, only precincts in the 8th Congressional District will have an election.**
