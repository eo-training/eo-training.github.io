## Half-Day Officers

Any officer may indicate a preference to work a half-day shift. However, half-day officers are only assigned if there are not enough full-day officers available.

(Note that this does not include individuals who qualify for reasonable accommodation under the ADA, which is handled separately. See more information below.)

In some past years, we have not had enough full-day officers and have therefore assigned half-day officers in some precincts. Beginning in 2018, we made significant efforts to improve our election officer recruiting and retention processes; since then, we have seen an increase in full-day officers each year and are now fortunate to have enough full-day officers to serve in all precincts each election.

While we appreciate the desire of individuals to work a half-day shift, there are many challenges associated with using half-day officers:

- It is often very difficult to find another half-day officer of the same party affiliation to serve in the same precinct, creating issues meeting party balance requirements set by the Code of Virginia.
- When half-day officers cancel, it is often very difficult to find a replacement officer. If no replacement officer is available, the precinct will be 0.5 officers below their target. If we assign a full-day officer as a replacement, the precinct will be 0.5 officers above their target, which increases costs above the planned budget.
- Half-day officers often do not sign all required election documents or, in some cases, sign documents they should not have signed.
- Some individuals indicate they are available for a full-day shift and are assigned as such, but then ask to be changed to a half-day officer, disrupting our planned assignments.

## ADA Accommodations

The Fairfax County Office of Elections fully adheres to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals upon request.

An individual meets the Americans with Disabilities with Act definition act of "disability" that would qualify them for reasonable accommodations if they have "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities."

To request reasonable accommodation as an election officer, contact [Elect@fairfaxcounty.gov](mailto:Elect@fairfaxcounty.gov). You must include sufficient medical documentation from an appropriate health care or rehabilitation professional with your request.

The medical documentation should describe the nature, severity, and duration of the impairment; the activity or activities that the impairment limits; the extent to which the impairment limits your ability to perform the activity or activities; and should substantiate why the requested reasonable accommodation is needed.

You may be asked to sign a limited release allowing our office to submit a list of specific follow-up questions to the health care professional.

Upon receipt of your reasonable accommodation request with sufficient accompanying medical documentation, the Office of Elections will begin the interactive process of understanding and addressing your accommodation request.

Note that submission of a reasonable accommodation request does not automatically grant you the option of serving a half-day shift. Per the [U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada), "The employer may choose among reasonable accommodations as long as the chosen accommodation is effective. Thus, as part of the interactive process, the employer may offer alternative suggestions for reasonable accommodations and discuss their effectiveness in removing the workplace barrier that is impeding the individual with a disability." We will seek to work with you to identify the best accommodation that will allow you to perform the essential functions of being an election officer. That may be a half-day shift or it may be a different accommodation.

Each individual and each situation is different and we look forward to working with you to be able to serve as an election officer!
