### New officers

To apply to become an election officer, complete this form: [https://apps.elections.virginia.gov/OnlineForms/OfficerofElection](https://apps.elections.virginia.gov/OnlineForms/OfficerofElection)

If we need you, we will contact you to schedule a paperwork appointment at our office. We have currently filled more than 90% of our assignments.

### Existing officers

As of early October, we are no longer using the Election Officer Portal for this election. All relevant information, such as precinct assignments and training class enrollments, will be emailed to officers instead. We are also extending all recent deadlines, such as for completing training quizzes, as a result of this change.

**We will email all officers soon about updated methods to review and submit information.**
