## Fairfax County Redistricting

**Overview**

As a result of the 2020 U.S. Census and subsequent adoption of new congressional district, Senate district, and House of Delegate District lines as drawn by the special masters for the Supreme Court of Virginia, local governing bodies were [required](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter3/section24.2-307/#:~:text=Requirements%20for%20county%20and%20city%20precincts.,precincts%20as%20it%20deems%20necessary) to eliminate any resulting split precincts. Each precinct must now be wholly contained within a single congressional, state senate, delegate, and magestieral district.

You can learn more about redistricting on the County website: https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/redistricting/what-is-redistricting


**Impact**

Fairfax County now has 264 voting precincts, an increase from 247 in the November 2021 election. The 264 precincts will be located in 230 polling places across the county, a slight increase from 229.

Although more than 100 precincts were impacted by required changes imposed by the new state district lines, we were able to keep 96.2% of voters assigned to thier current polling place. 

You can check your precinct and polling place [here](https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/Lookup/polling).

As an election officer, you may be assigned to a new precinct. You may even be part of the very first election officer team to serve in a new precinct if you are serving in the June 2022 Primary or November 2022 General Election!

**Precinct Changes**

As a result of required changes to precinct boundaries, we eliminated 10 precincts. Many of these precincts were merged with a neighboring precinct that used the same polling place. In these instances, voters will continue to use the same polling place and election officers will work as one team to manage one precinct, instead of two managing two sepereate precincts.

We eliminated 10 precincts:
- 133 DANBURY
- 333 SALONA #2
- 430 LANE #2
- 531 BAILEYS #2
- 532 WEYANOKE #2
- 534 CAMELOT #2
- 619 BELVOIR
- 930 LEES CORNER
- 932 STONE SOUTH
- 933 COMPTON


We were required to create 27 new precicnts to accomodate the new state lines. Many of these precincts have a new name, but will continue to use the same polling place.

We added 27 new precicnts:
- 136 WOODSON #2
- 137 SIDEBURN #2
- 138 EAGLE VIEW #2
- 241 FLINT HILL #2
- 242 WESTBRIAR #2
- 243 SUNRISE VALLEY #2
- 244 FOX MILL #2
- 245 NORTH POINT #2
- 432 FRANCONIA #2
- 433 LYNBROOK #2
- 631 POHICK CREEK
- 632 HALLEY #1
