title: "ABSENTEE VOTING: Drop-Off Boxes"
---

For the November 2020 General and Special Elections, voters who request a mailed absentee ballot also have the option of returning their ballot in a drop-off box.

Absentee ballot drop-off boxes are available at the following locations:

- Fairfax County Government Center until November 3 at 7:00 PM. The drop-off box is open 24 hours per day and monitored by camera.

- Various satellite voting locations from October 14 to October 31 (note that not all satellite locations are open all days - see website for details). The drop-off boxes are open only during voting hours and are monitored by satellite staff at all times.

- All 243 polling places on election day, November 3. The drop-off box at each polling place will be open during voting hours, 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM, and will be monitored by election officers at all times.

We will provide more information about election day drop-off box procedures to all Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs during their pre-election briefing. We will also email information to all election officers closer to election day.
