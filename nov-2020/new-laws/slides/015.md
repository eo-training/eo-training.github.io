title: "ACCEPTABLE IDs: Sample IDs (Continued)"
---

Here are some samples of IDs that are now valid for the November 2020 General and Special Elections following passage of new laws. The list includes:

- A current bank statement (with voter name and address)
- A current utility bill (with voter name and address)
- A current government check (with voter name and address)
- A current government document (with voter name and address)

Note that the Code of Virginia states that all of these IDs must be “current” - this is defined as issued within the last 12 months. 

If you’re ever not sure about a particular ID, ask your Chief, Assistant Chief, or Non-Routine Specialist! They receive additional training on how to handle non-routine voter situations. If they are not sure, they can always call our office for help.
