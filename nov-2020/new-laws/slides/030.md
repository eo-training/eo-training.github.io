title: "ABSENTEE VOTING: No-Excuse Absentee Voting"
---

The biggest change to election laws this year involved who could vote absentee before election day. Previously, you had to have a reason to cast an absentee ballot. For example, if youâ€™ve served as an election officer before, you probably remember selecting code 4A on your absentee ballot application form to vote absentee before election day.

Now, the law has changed so that any voter may vote absentee, without any excuse required. As in other states that have made this type of change, we are now seeing a lot more people choosing to vote absentee.
