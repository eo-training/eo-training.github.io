title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS, PART 2: Voter Registration Application"
---

Here is a sample of a Virginia Voter Registration Application. This form is used for new voters, as well as voters who simply need to update their name or address.

Whenever you have a voter who has moved without updating their voter registration, you should always offer them a Voter Registration Application. If they complete it and turn it in to you, you may return it in envelope #8 and our office will process it shortly after the election.
