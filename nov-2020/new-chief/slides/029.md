title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS, PART 2: What if...voter has no ID?"
---

If a voter does not have an acceptable ID with them, they still have multiple options to vote.

-   The voter can retrieve their ID, if it's simply in their car or at home.
-   The voter can complete the new ID Confirmation Statement. (If they do this, remember to select the "Voter Signed Oath" flag on the Poll Pad when checking them in.)
-   Always offer the voter a provisional ballot as an option.

Provisional ballots are ballots that are set aside on election day and adjudicated later. There is a common misconception that provisional ballots are only counted in close races or to break ties; this is not true! Provisional ballots are reviewed by the Electoral Board in the days after the election and, if counted, they are included in the official election results.
