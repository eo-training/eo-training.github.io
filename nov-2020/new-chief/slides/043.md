title: "PROVISIONAL BALLOTS: Reminders"

Also, a reminder that you should **NOT** check-in provisional voters on your Poll Pad. Unfortunately, at this time we are unable to disable the provisional flag on the Poll Pad software as it is used by many jurisdictions and states whose laws are slightly different than ours. But in Virginia, provisional voters are never marked on the pollbook because we do not know yet if their ballot will be counted.

In addition, do **NOT** let voters cast provisional ballots on the DS200 scanner. It's very important to help provisional voters at the Chief's Table, far away from the DS200 scanner. Once you issue a ballot to a provisional voter, stay with them until they place it in the provisional envelope and return it to you.
