title: "NON-ROUTINE VOTERS, PART 1: Officers vs Chiefs"
---

As a regular election officer in the past, you have helped process all routine voters. These are voters who can be checked-in on the Poll Pad without issue.

As a Chief or Assistant Chief now, you will help process all non-routine voters. If an election officer cannot check-in a voter, they will direct them to the Chief's Table for you to help them.

**<span style="color:red;">NOTE: For the November 2020 General and Special Elections, a new election officer position has been created: Non-Routine Specialist. This election officer can help you process some non-routine voters.</span>**
