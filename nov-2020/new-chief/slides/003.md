title: "INTRO: Election Officer Class Review"

The General Assembly met earlier this year and passed many changes to election laws which took effect on July 1, 2020. For us, the biggest change was to the list of IDs acceptable for voting and to certain parts of the check-in process. You will need to complete the Changes to Virginia Election Laws training module to familiarize yourself with the changes.

If you need a refresher on setting up and using Poll Pads or DS200 scanners, feel free to pause this training and view part or all of the online New Election Officer class.
