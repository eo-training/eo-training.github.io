Now let's go over some equipment tips to keep election day running smoothly.

-   Remember that you can call Technical Support for help.
-   If any equipment issues arise during the day, document them in your Chief's Notes.
-   Tape all cords down & out of the way of voters walking.
-   Keep your Poll Pads within 30 feet of each other or they will stop synchronizing.
-   If your ExpressVote has no sound, first check that the volume is turned up.
-   Always use a surge protector between the wall outlet and your DS200 (and other voting equipment).
