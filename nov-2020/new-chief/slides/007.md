Letâ€™s go over some examples of the work that can be performed by the Non-Routine Specialist:
1. Help Pollbook Officers determine when a voter should be directed to the Chief or Assistant Chief for further assistance.
2. Assist Election Officers with any questions about the new ID requirements.
3. Help Election Officers process individuals who return their absentee ballot and wish to vote in the regular manner.
4. Assist voters after completing the Request for Assistance form.
5. Help voters who use the ExpressVote accessible voting machine.
6. Assist with curbside voting.
7. Help voters complete provisional ballot envelopes and related materials (only after the Chief has determined a voter should be issued a provisional ballot).
