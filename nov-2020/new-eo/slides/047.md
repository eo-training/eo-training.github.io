Let's do a quick review. Take a moment to think about these questions before you read the answer below.

1. **What time must you arrive? When can you leave?** All election officers must arrive no later than 5:00 AM and stay until the Chief dismisses everyone.

2. **Is an expired driver’s license an acceptable ID for voting purposes?** Yes! Remember, the law now allows a voter to use a driver’s license as their ID for voting, regardless of expiration date. If a voter did not have an acceptable ID, they also now have the option of completing an ID Confirmation Statement and voting normally.

3. **Which Poll Pad flag will you never use?** You will never use the Provisional flag on the Poll Pads. Always send provisional voters to the Chief.

4. **What should you do if you're not sure how to handle a non-routine voter or any other situation?** If you're not sure about anything on election day, just say one simple word: "CHIEF!" Again, Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs are trained to handle all non-routine situations.
