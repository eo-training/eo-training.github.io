Lastly, we will provide you with 15 Round Blue Social Distancing Signs to place on the floor in 6-foot intervals. If your voting room is in a school, school staff will provide you with large cones and you should tape the Round Blue Social Distancing Signs to the cones and place them in 6-foot intervals. In other locations you can use blue painter's tape to **tape** the signs to the floor.

**IMPORTANT: Do not affix the round signs directly to the floor. Tape them to the cones or the floor.**

You can use the tape in addition (if necessary) to mark X's on the floor in 6-foot intervals.

Place Round Signs and/or wide blue "painter's tape" in 6-foot intervals as follows:

- Leading to the door to the voting room
- Leading to the Check-in table
- Leading to the Voting Booth area and Voting Machine area
