What to do if a voter appears ill:

- Remember that it is very possible that the voter has allergies or other health issues not related to COVID-19.
- Remember that we are **not** permitted to ask a voter if they have COVID-19 or to treat a voter differently if they have a cough or if they appear to be ill.
- **Never infringe on a voter's right to vote.**
- Practice social distancing by staying at least 6 feet away from all voters, Election Officers, Poll Watchers, and any other individuals at the polling place.
