In this example, the ballot officer announces that the contest is “Governor”.  

	1. There is a write-in candidate (i.e., a person whose name was not already on the ballot), so the ballot officer says “Write-in” (this alerts the EO with the write-in certification sheet).  The ballot officer then says the name of the write-in candidate, “Joe Smith”.  
	2. The recording officer with the tally sheet that includes Governor makes one tally mark for the Write-in section and confirms by saying “Write-in”.
	3. The recording officer with the write-in certification writes the name Joe Smith in the block for Governor and confirms by saying the name back.  Note that Joe Smith has been a write-in on other ballots, but the name is written down every time it is read.

The verifying officer checks that the ballot was read correctly and then watches to ensure that the votes and names are recorded correctly.

After the recording officers have confirmed their entries, the ballot officer reads the next contest on that ballot, continuing to read contests until all contests on the ballot have been read.  If there is no vote entered for a specific contest, the ballot officer will announce the contest and say “blank”, for example, “Attorney General, blank”.
