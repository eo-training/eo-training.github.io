title: "Reading Ballots & Recording Votes"
---

The handcount team’s second critical task is to record the votes on ballots.  This involves reading the ballots and physically recording the votes.

The ballot officer reads all contests and issues, one ballot at a time, until all ballots in the batch have been read.
	- announce name of contest and name of candidate who received the vote for that contest
	- if a write-in was selected, announce name of contest and say “Write-in”, then state the name of the write-in candidate.
	- if no candidate was selected, announce name of contest and say “Blank”

The verifying officer is looking at the ballot and listening to the ballot officer to ensure the correct contests and candidates are announced.

Recording officers with tally sheets find the correct contest on their tally sheet and enter one tally mark for the candidate.  If the ballot officer announced “Write-in”, the recording officer enters a tally mark for that contest in the “Write-in” line.  The recording officer acknowledges the entry by responding with the name of the candidate.

The Ballot Officer will then read or spell the name of the write-in candidate.  The recording officer with the write-in certification sheet finds the correct contest and records the name of the candidate.  The same name will be entered every time it is announced.  The recording officer may consult with the ballot officer about the spelling of candidate names.  The recording officer acknowledges the entry by repeating back the name of the candidate.

The verifying officer checks that the ballot was read correctly and then watches to ensure that the votes were recorded correctly.

Keep the announcements short and to the point – for example, say “Governor”, not “Office of Governor”.
