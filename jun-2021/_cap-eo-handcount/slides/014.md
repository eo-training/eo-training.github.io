title: "Write-in Certification"
---

The Recording Officer records the name of each valid write-in candidate on the Write-in Certification sheet (only when there is a write-in candidate for a contest).  The Write-in Certification sheet contains all contests on the ballot.  A valid name is written each time the Ballot Officer reads it (in the example for Governor, Joe Smith was read three times and written down three times). 

Write-in Certification sheets, just like the tally sheets, are used for specific types of ballots.  In the example above, this Certification sheet is only used for ballots from CD 8.
 
Invalid write-in entries are not written down, but instead a tally mark is made in the “Invalid Candidates” box for that contest.   Invalid names typically include cartoon, movie or TV characters or comments such as “none of the above”.  If the Ballot Officer is not certain a write-in name is invalid, he or she can discuss the name with the Verifying and Recording Officers.

It is important for Recording Officers to remain alert as ballots are read because there are not many write-in votes compared to the large number of regular candidate votes.

Write-ins are not allowed for primary elections, so write-in certification sheets are not used for primary elections.

Note that you do NOT total the number of invalid votes or names.
