title: "Recording Ballots"
---
 
The top section of the first tally sheet is where the ballot count is recorded.  The number of ballots in each batch of ballots is recorded  (in the example, 30 + 40 + 15).  

After the chief has notified the team that there are no more ballots to count or the tally sheet is full, the batch numbers are added together to get “Total Ballots” (in the example, there are 85 total ballots).
