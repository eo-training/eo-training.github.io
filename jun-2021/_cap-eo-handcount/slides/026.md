Congratulations! You have now completed the online training module for handcounting.  

To receive credit for EO training, you must still take and pass the quiz, which covers material from both the CAP Absentee EO and Handcount training modules. You can find the quiz in the Election Officer Portal. Log in, go to the Training tab, scroll down, and look in the bottom-right for a link labeled "CAP Quiz". If you do not pass the quiz the first time, you can take it again until you pass.

If you need any help, don't hesitate to call us at 703-324-7739 or email us at CentralAbsentee@fairfaxcounty.gov

Thank you for serving as an election officer!
