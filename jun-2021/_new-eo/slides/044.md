Each precinct receives 1 iSync drive, which is a small "thumb drive" that must be inserted into each Poll Pad individually to update them. The iSync drive contains the most current list of registered voters and absentee voters.

You may ask, why do we need to use an iSync drive? Poll Pads must be prepared *2 weeks* before election day so we can send them to your polling place in time, but do not include the final absentee voters or last-minute changes to voter registration. iSync drives are prepared *2 days* before election day, after voter registration and in-person absentee voting have ended. That's why it's so important to use the iSync drive to update your Poll Pads in the morning!

During opening procedures, insert your iSync drive into each Poll Pad to update it. If a precinct forgets to update a Poll Pad, it will have an older list of voters and it can take the Office of Elections up to 4 hours to reconcile the data for each Poll Pad.
