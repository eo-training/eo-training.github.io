There are many IDs that are acceptable for voting purposes:

- A Virginia driver’s license.

- A United States passport.

- A Virginia voter ID card.

- A voter confirmation document (e.g. Official Voter Registration Notice postcard). 

- Other IDs issued by the federal government, the state of Virginia government, or local Virginia government.

- An employer ID, which must have a photo.

- A Virginia high school ID card.

- A college/university ID from schools with a campus anywhere in Virginia (the Chief has a list on election day).

- Any other US college/university ID *with photo*. **IMPORTANT: As of Jan 1, 2021, the Code of Virginia now requires non-Virginia college/university IDs to include a photo**.

- A copy of a *current* utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or any other government document containing the name and address of the voter. (“Current” is considered as within the last 12 months.)
