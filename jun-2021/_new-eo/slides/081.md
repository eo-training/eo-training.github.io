Remember your iSync drive? Just as you used it during opening procedures, you will need to use it again during closing procedures.

During closing procedures, insert your iSync drive in each Poll Pad to export the final voter list. If your Poll Pads do not wirelessly synchronize properly during the day, we can reconcile the data using the exports on the iSync drive.
