The last step is to unlock and open the DS200 Ballot Compartment. With multiple officers present, carefully move all voted ballots into the voted ballot boxes and seal them. The ballots must be removed from each DS200 separately and packed into separate boxes. The Chief will have more detailed instructions for this task.

Similarly, you will also pack all unvoted ballots into boxes and seal them. This is because all ballots, whether voted or not, must be secured. The Chief will return all voted and unvoted ballots on election night and they will be transported to the courthouse for safekeeping.

Finally, be sure to return all materials to the Chief, including the signed tapes, all memory sticks, the printed instructions, the Machine Certification Form, and the DS200 keys.
