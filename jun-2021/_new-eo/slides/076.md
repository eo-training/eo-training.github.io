At 7:00 PM (or after the last voter leaves), the Chief will lock the voting room and begin closing procedures. The following tasks must be completed before you can leave:

- Fill out all required documents, including the Statement of Results and the Machine Certification Form.

- Close and pack the Poll Pads.

- Close and pack the ExpressVote.

- Close and pack the DS200 scanners.

- Secure all voted ballots and unvoted ballots, and

- Remove and pack all signs and PPE Supplies.

NOTE: Remember that the two Absentee Ballot Collector officers will secure absentee ballots from the Drop-Off Box and immediately drive them to the Government Center. They are the only officers who will leave the polling place early.
