Let's continue the steps to close a DS200.

- **STEP 6**: After all reports have printed, press the red "Finished - Turn Off" button on the screen.

- **STEP 7**: Unplug the power cord from the wall. Close and re-lock the power cord compartment on the back of the DS200.

- **STEP 8**: After the DS200 powers off, remove the memory stick in the Printer Compartment (which is in front of the screen) and remove the memory stick in the Battery Compartment (which is behind the screen).
