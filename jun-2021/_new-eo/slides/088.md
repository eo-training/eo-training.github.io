Let's continue the steps to close a DS200.

- **STEP 4**: Now that you have removed the red sticker seal on the DS200's printer access door, unlock and open it. Inside, there is a physical button labeled "Close Poll". Press it.

- **STEP 5**: The DS200 screen will update and ask for confirmation that you want to close polls. Press the red "Close Poll" button on the screen. Multiple reports will now print. After all reports have printed, tear them off in one piece. Two officers must sign at the bottom of each of the three copies of the Voting Results Report, then give them to the Chief.
