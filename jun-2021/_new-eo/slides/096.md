Congratulations! You have now completed the online training class for new and experienced election officers.

To receive credit for this class, you must still take and pass the quiz. You can find the quiz in the Election Officer Portal. Go to the Training tab, scroll down, and look in the bottom-right for a link labeled "Quiz". If you do not pass the quiz the first time, you can take it again. If you need any help, don't hesitate to call or email us.

This class is now complete. Thank you and we know you will do great on election day!
