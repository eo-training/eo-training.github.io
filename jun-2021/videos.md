As you learned in the New & Experienced Election Officer training class, the Poll Pads have been updated with new software. Everything may look a little different, but most buttons and functions are generally in the same place!

By request, we have prepared the below videos to help you with some common situations you may encounter on election day. Of course, if you need help or have questions on election day, call Technical Support anytime!

# Federal Only voters

**If a voter is marked as "Federal Only" on the Poll Pad, call Voter Registration before checking in the voter.** They may or may not be eligible to vote in this election.

# Advanced Options search

**When using the Advanced Options search function, make sure to tap the 'Search' button to initiate the search.** If you cannot find a voter by searching for their name, use the Advanced Options search. First, tap the 'Advanced Options' button. Then, select your search criteria, type the search query (e.g. birth year or voter ID), and tap 'Done' on the keyboard. <u>Lastly, you ust tap the 'Search' button.</u>

**The Advanced Options search function does not support searching by address this election.** If you cannot find a voter by name, try the other advanced options. If you still cannot find the voter, call the office for help.
