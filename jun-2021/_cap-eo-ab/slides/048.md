What do you do if the voter does not enclose an ID in the mailer?  This voter actually has a number of days post-election to bring an acceptable ID to the Office of Elections.

Even if no identification is present in the mailer, EO#1 must evaluate the B envelope.

Is the ID missing but the B envelope completed correctly?  Place a bright green provisional sticker on the upper right-hand corner of the mailer.  Be sure to enter the correct Congressional District for this voter from the voter information label.  **Do not check this voter in!** Do not open or remove the ballot from the B envelope.  Place the mailer with all contents intact into the Void/Provisional table box.

Is the ID missing and the B envelope contains material omissions?  This ballot must be rejected.  Check in the voter, using the rejected flag on the voterâ€™s detail page.  **Do not remove the ballot from the B envelope.**  Place the mailer with all contents in the Rejected Ballot table box.
