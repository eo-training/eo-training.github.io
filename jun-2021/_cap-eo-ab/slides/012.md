On arrival at the Government Center, your location and team number are on your badge.  Find your team quickly.  The chief will administer the election oath to all EOs; you must sign the election oath as well as the compensation sheet.
 
The chief will brief all EOs on conducting the CAP operation and will provide a review of voter submission processing procedures.
 
The polls will open at 6 a.m., so it is important to arrive on time.
