title: "Voter Submission – A Voter in an Envelope"
---

On election day, when a voter arrives at the polling location, the voter provides name, address, and identification, all before casting a ballot.  Of course, the process is very different for an authorized absentee voter who is casting a ballot by mail or drop box.

An absentee voter who is taking advantage of the Vote By Mail option must submit a voter submission that contains, at a minimum, 3 components:
1.  A return mailer
2.  A "B" envelope inside the return mailer
3.  A ballot inside the "B" envelope 

These 3 components may look different based on the status and location of the voter, but they will always be there.

An absentee voter who opts to make use of a drop box does not have to use the return mailer.

For a CAP election officer, the “B” envelope is very important during ballot processing.  The "B" envelope represents the absentee voter.  On the B envelope, the voter is stating the appropriate name and address.  In lieu of presenting identification, the voter provides a signature attesting that the information is correct.  

Note that in some instances, a voter must provide additional documentation.  This 4th component will also be placed in the outer mailer.  We will talk about these specific instances later.
