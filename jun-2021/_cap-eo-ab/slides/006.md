title: "CAP Responsibilities"
---

This training module is focused on CAP Absentee processes for election officers.  There is a separate training module for CAP Early Voting election officers.

CAP Absentee has three major responsibilities for processing voter submissions:

1.  Adjudicating – evaluating the voter submission to determine if the voter has completely and correctly filled out the required information
2.  Checking in – using an electronic pollbook (EPB) to check in voters
3.  Counting votes – scanning or handcounting the voters’ ballots to determine how they awarded their votes

In contrast, CAP EV has one responsibility for in-person early voting ballots: to record the number of ballots, number of voters, and votes cast.  Voters who choose to participate in early voting at an in-person satellite location are checked in on the statewide data base, mark their ballots, and then insert their ballots into a digital scanner at that location.  CAP EV’s responsibility on election day is to receive the digital scanners from early voting locations and tabulate the votes from all those locations.
