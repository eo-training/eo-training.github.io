There are two election officer training modules.

This training module is focused on CAP Absentee processes for election officers.  

Review all information in these slides and notes at your own pace.  You may pause at any time.

After completing both modules, you must take and pass a quiz to receive credit and to participate in CAP operations. 

If you are selected to be an EO for CAP Early Voting, there is a separate training module and quiz for CAP Early Voting election officers.
