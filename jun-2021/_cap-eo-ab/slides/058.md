title: "Processing Absentee Voter Submissions"
---

The diagram is a simplified chart of the major actions involved in processing voter submissions.

The team receives stacks of voter submissions and processes them one by one.

EO #1 verifies that the voter submission can be processed, then proceeds to the review of the B envelope.

If the B envelope is correctly filled out, EO #2 checks the voter in.

EO #3 removes ballots.

Processsed ballots are prepared for counting.  Undamaged digital ballots are scanned.  Damaged or email ballots are handcounted.
