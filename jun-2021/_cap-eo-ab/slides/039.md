Once EO#2 states that the voter check-in is confirmed, EO#1 passes the B envelope  to EO#3 with the ballot still inside.  

EO#3 opens the B envelope, removes the ballot and places the ballot, FOLDED, in the appropriate ballot box.  EO#3 then places the mailer with the remaining contents in the "Mailers with B Envelopes" table box.
