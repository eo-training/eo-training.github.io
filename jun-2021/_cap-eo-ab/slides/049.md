title: "Cured Voter Submission"
---

Virginia state law offers an absentee voter the opportunity to correct information on the B envelope.  If a voter has provided incorrect or incomplete information on the B envelope that would cause it to be rejected, Fairfax County will notify the voter of the material omission and further stipulate how to correct the issue so the ballot may be counted. This is called the “curing” process.
 
Some absentee voters may opt to come, in person, to the Office of Elections to "cure" their submission.

Others may choose to provide (by mail, email) a signed affidavit containing the corrected information (Figure 10A).  When this affidavit arrives at the Office of Elections, a staff member will place it in the voter’s original mailer with the original B envelope.  In addition, an orange circle will be placed on the return mailer; this is a sign that a "curing" affidavit may be inside.  In this case, election officers will review the information in the affidavit for material omissions and use the affidavit information to check in a voter on the EPB.

Note that in some circumstances, it may be necessary to review the affidavit in conjunction with the original B envelope.  For example, if a voter forgot the city or zip code on the original B envelope and then submitted an affidavit with only the corrected city/zip code, election officers may look at both pieces of documentation to determine whether to accept or reject.
