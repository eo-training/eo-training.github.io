Title: "CD Color Codes"
---

In this image of outgoing mailer envelopes, please note the different colored stripes printed above the County of Fairfax, Office of Elections address in the upper left of the front of the outgoing mailer.  These are circled in red.  The color codes are used for both outgoing mailer and return mailer envelopes.

The color of this stripe indicates the Congressional District (CD) in which the voter resides.  The number of the CD is also in the color block.  If additional information is needed, such as a House of Delegates district number, it is placed to the right of the color block.

These different colored stripes serve as a valuable sorting tool to ensure that ballots from the same CDs are kept together during the processing operations.
