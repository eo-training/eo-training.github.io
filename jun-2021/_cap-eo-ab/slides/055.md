title: "What is handcounting?"
---
 
Some ballots can’t be scanned by a digital scanner.  Digital ballots contain codes which are read by a digital scanner, so if the digital ballot is damaged the scanner is unable to read it (also known as a “Digital Not Scanned”, or DNS ballot) .  Email ballots are printed by the overseas and military voter on various types of paper, which the scanner also can’t read.

These ballots are counted by hand.  Election officers who are already working at CAP are selected to be part of a handcount team.  The team will read the votes on the paper ballots and record either votes for candidates on the ballot (using a tally sheet) or the names of write-in candidates (using a write-in certification sheet).

For more information regarding the handcount process, refer to the CAP EO handcount training module.
