title: "Ballot Processing Teams – 3 EOs"
---

On election day, voter submission processing is completed by teams of 3 election officers.  It is a best practice to become familiar with the responsibilities and functions of each team member, allowing for flexibility during the day.

EO#1 is the Check-in Officer.  The Check-in Officer initially reviews the ballot batch to look for mismatched congressional districts (CDs), Federal Write-in Absentee Ballots (FWABs), and unused or undeliverable submissions.  The Check-in Officer examines each individual B envelope for completeness and makes an initial determination to accept or reject.  The Check-in Officer then clearly reads the name and address of the voter from the B envelope so the EPB Officer can locate the voter.  

EO#2 is the Electronic Pollbook (EPB) Officer.  The EPB Officer locates the correct absentee voter in the electronic poll book, verifies that the information on the voter’s B envelope is correct, and checks the voter in on the EPB. 

EO#3 is the Ballot Officer.  The Ballot Officer opens the accepted B envelope, removes the ballot and places it FOLDED in the appropriate ballot box, and returns the opened B envelopes to the mailers and places them in the table box.  

This is a cursory overview of EO assignments.  For a more detailed overview of 3 Election Officer (EO) voter submission processing, refer to the EO Manual.
