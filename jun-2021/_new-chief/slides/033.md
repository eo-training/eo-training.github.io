What if someone shows up to vote, but they are not registered in your precinct?

- First, you should strongly encourage them to go to the correct precinct, if possible. Virginia law states that you must vote in your registered precinct on election day.
- If the voter is not able to go to the correct precinct in time, then as always, offer a provisional ballot. All provisional ballots are adjudicated by the Electoral Board.
