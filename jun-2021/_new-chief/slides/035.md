Let's take a look at an example situation. What if a voter moved in July 2019 to Maryland?

- First, we look for the row that matches the moving date. July 2019 is between 11/7/2018 and 11/3/2020, so we are looking in the middle row.
- Next, we look for the column that matches how far the voter moved. In this case, they moved to another state, which is the rightmost column.
- Therefore, we can see that "No", they cannot vote routinely. But again, you should always offer a provisional ballot to the voter.

As you can see on the chart, no matter when a voter moves out-of-state (even if it was the day before the election), they are not eligible to vote routinely in Virginia anymore.
