Based on a new law, Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Boxes are now a permanent part of the voting process in Virginia. On election day, all polling places will have an Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box, where voters can return completed absentee ballots without waiting in the main voting line.

Your precinct may be assigned two **Absentee Ballot Collectors**. During the day, these officers will perform all regular election officer duties. But immediately after polls close at 7:00 PM, these officers will secure and drive all absentee ballots from the Drop-Off box to the Office of Elections at the Fairfax County Government Center, then go home.
