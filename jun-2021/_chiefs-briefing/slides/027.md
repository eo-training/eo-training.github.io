Please use the Supply List in the beginning of the Chiefs Notebook to make sure you have all the supplies. Try to keep the papers in the black rolling kit in the same order so they will be easier to find.

Remember you have blue handout sheets at the end of your notebook to give to your officers to help them pack up supplies at the end of the evening.
