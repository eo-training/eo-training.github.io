Once you have closed down and unplugged the DS200 and the ExpressVote machines, you will need to remove the USB flash drives. You must remove all media sticks from all machines, whether you used them for voting or not.

Each DS200 contains 1 main USB flash drive and 1 backup USB flash drive. Return these in the purple pouch.

Each ExpressVote contains just 1 USB flash drive. Return these in the orange #7 pouch.
