This is the Election Officer Evaluation Form. We have updated it significantly so that you can review all of your officers on one page.

We use this information to assign the best possible team to each precinct in future elections. If you have officers who are truly excellent, or any officers who need improvement, please make sure to add written comments to help us understand why. We review these very carefully after each election.

You should complete this form by 5:00 PM on election day, so it doesn't distract you from closing the polls.
