The iSync drive arrives in the Sheriff's Envelope that the Chief receives. Do not forget to bring it on election morning! Our suggestion? Put it in your black rolling kit, so you can't possibly forget it.

A very important reminder: make sure you insert the iSync drive into each and every Poll Pad in use! Remember, the iSync drive contains the most updated list of registered voters and absentee voters. If you do not use the iSync drive, your Poll Pads will be out-of-date.
