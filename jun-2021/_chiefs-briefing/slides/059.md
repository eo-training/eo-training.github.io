When your election officers have a non-routine voter, have them fill out a Voter Referral Worksheet with the "reason for the referral" box checked off.

This worksheet will help you understand the issue you need to resolve and where to find it in the "What-Ifs" section of your Chiefs Notebook.

The "What-Ifs" section of the Chiefs Notebook is your best friend on election day â€“ it covers all non-routine voter situations and what you need to do to help someone vote!
