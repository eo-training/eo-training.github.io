The Virginia General Assembly passed legislation impacting the requirements for Voter IDs at polling places that took effect on July 1, 2020. There were also minor additional changes that took effect on January 1, 2021. You will have a one-page list of all acceptable IDs that you can check at any time.

Remember, there are many additional IDs that may now be accepted, including:

- Virginia driver's license or other DMV-issued ID card (regardless of expiration date)
- Voter confirmation documents
- US college/university ID with photo (campus located anywhere outside Virginia)
- A copy of a current (within 12 months) utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document containing the name and address of the voter.

Digital copies of some IDs are now acceptable including a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document with the voter's name and address.
