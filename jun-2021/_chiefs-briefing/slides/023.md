When you visit your polling place, either the week before election day or during setup, verify that you received:

- Gray supply cart
- Yellow A-frame curbside voting sign
- Cardboard box containing Absentee Ballot Drop-Off Box
- Cardboard box containing Acrylic Sneeze Guards

IMPORTANT: Check the precinct number on the gray cart is correct. If it is not, let us know immediately.
