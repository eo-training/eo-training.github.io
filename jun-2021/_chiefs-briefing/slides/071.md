Before you or your Election Officers close the DS200 and begin completing the election forms, you must check the Auxiliary Compartment to make sure it's empty, even if you don't think you used it during the day.

If there are any ballots inside the Auxiliary Compartment, remove them and insert them into the scanner. If any ballot cannot be scanned, you will have to hand-count them.
