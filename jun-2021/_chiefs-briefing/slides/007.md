Based on new guidance from the Commonwealth of Virginia, we have updated the requirements regarding use of face coverings by election officers in a polling place:

- If you are fully vaccinated, you are no longer required to wear a face covering while working at the polls. The Office of Elections still encourages election officers to wear a face covering when assisting voters.

- If you are not fully vaccinated, you must continue to wear a face covering at all times when at a voting station in the voting room. If you are unable to wear a face mask, you may wear a face shield. You may remove your face covering when you are on break, away from a voting station.

- **IMPORTANT** : Do not ask other election officers to provide proof of vaccination status.

NOTE: If your polling place building has more specific requirements about face masks, you will have to adhere to those.
