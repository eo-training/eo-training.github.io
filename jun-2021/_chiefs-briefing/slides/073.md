Remember that the Absentee Ballot Collectors are waiting to take custody of the sealed Purple Pouch containing election media from the DS200 machines.

During closing, your first priority should be to shut down the DS200 scanners and remove the USB flash drives as soon as possible.

Ensure that the Purple Pouch contains 4 USB flash drives (2 from each DS200) before sealing it.

Once it is sealed, give the Purple Pouch to the Absentee Ballot Collectors through a doorway.
