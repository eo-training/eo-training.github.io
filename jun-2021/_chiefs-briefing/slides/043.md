Each precinct will receive 4 clear **Acrylic Sneeze Guards** to be placed at the Check-In tables, Ballot Table, Chief's Table, and other areas. Note that there is a cutout at the bottom to allow voters and officers to easily exchange materials (e.g. voter IDs, ballots, etc.).

NOTE: The sneeze guards you receive will be completely transparent after you remove the protective cover. However, in this picture, we have added blue tape to the edges of the acrylic sneeze guard so you can see it better.
