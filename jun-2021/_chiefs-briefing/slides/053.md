If you have Poll Watchers, you must collect a written authorization form from them. They cannot simply show you an email on their phone.

Remember that once authorized, Poll Watchers may move around within a voting room. They may observe, but not interact with voters. If they see an issue, they should talk to you directly as the Chief or Assistant Chief.
