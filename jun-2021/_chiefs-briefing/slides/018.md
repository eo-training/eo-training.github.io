All Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs must pickup essential election supplies the week before election day.

Everyone will receive a Chiefs Notebook and election supply envelope at your Supply Pickup time.

Usually, the Chief in each precinct receives just a black rolling kit. This election, the Chief will also receive some PPE materials (in one cardboard box and one large Zip-Loc bag).

If you are the Chief, please make sure you have enough space in your car to take all these materials with you. We will have a staff member take them to your car and help load them inside.
