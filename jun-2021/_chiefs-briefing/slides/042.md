Use arrows to direct voters.

- Place the yellow directional arrows on the floor to direct voters.
- If needed, use blue painter's tape to create additional arrows on the floor to direct voters.
- Direct voters into the voting room and through the voting process in a manner that will prevent them from crossing paths.
- Maintain 6-feet of social distancing.
