**VOTING EQUIPMENT, POLL PADS, AND BALLOTS**

We have allocated 2 DS200 voting machines, 2 ExpressVote machines, 3 to 6 Poll Pads, 1 to 3 boxes of ballots, and 110 ExpressVote cards to each precinct. You should set up one DS200 and one ExpressVote machine. The second DS200 and the second ExpressVote machine will be available as a backup.

**NON-ROUTINE AND PROVISIONAL VOTERS**

You are required to offer a provisional ballot to any voter who is not able to vote at your precinct in the routine manner. At the same time, you are also responsible for directing voters to the correct precinct so they will have the best chance of having their ballot count. Call voter registration staff at **703-324-8765** if you have any questions about Non-Routine or provisional voters on Election Day.
