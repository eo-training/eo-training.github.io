You should assemble the absentee ballot drop-off box before election day.

The drop-off box should be located just outside the building entrance for the polling place, away from the line of voters, in an area that is visible to voters.

The election officer who monitors the drop-off box should also look for curbside voters and notify the Chief/Assistant Chief when there is a curbside voter.

The drop-off box must be monitored by an election officer from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on election day.

If practical, the individual who monitors the drop-off box should also serve as the Greeter.

Voters are not required to provide identification or identify themselves when they place a voted absentee ballot envelope in the drop-off box.

Voters are permitted to place more than one voted absentee ballot envelope in the drop-off box.

We have designated two officers as absentee ballot collectors. These individuals will be responsible for counting and securing voted absentee ballots at 7:00 p.m. and taking these ballots, along with the purple pouch containing the election media from the DS200s, to the parking lot at the Fairfax County Government Center.

The absentee ballot collectors will also be responsible for emptying the drop-off box and securing absentee ballots during the day if the drop-off box is full.
