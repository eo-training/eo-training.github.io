If you have any questions, submit them by email to: **ElectionOfficers@fairfaxcounty.gov**

We will host an optional Zoom webinar on Friday, June 4 at 2:00 PM to answer your questions. We will email a recording to all Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs afterwards.

You have now finished reviewing the online Chiefs Briefing. You must return to the Election Officer Portal and take the quiz to acknowledge you have reviewed this briefing.

**Thank you and have a great election day!**
