6.  Where is the preprinted voter information label?  In the upper left hand corner of the B envelope.

7.  You will require two sets of logon credentials.  What are they?  Fairfax County and VERIS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

8.  Can batch scanning be used for email ballots?  No, batch scanning requires a scannable bar code.  Email ballot mailers do not have bar codes.

9.  The VERIS Officer must verbally confirm three pieces of information to the Ballot Officer.  What are they?  The VERIS Officer must verbally confirm 1) the voter’s name (as read from the computer screen), 2) that the voter’s ballot status indicates "Pre-Processed", and 3) that the changes have been "Saved".

10. After a set of envelopes has been successfully saved in VERIS, what happens next?  Both team members work together to remove the ballots from the B envelopes, to unfold and flatten the ballots, and to reconcile the counts between ballots and B envelopes.
