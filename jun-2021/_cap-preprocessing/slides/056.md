During reconciliation, it is a common error to confuse or use interchangeably the terms "Digital Not Scanned (DNS)" and "Not Processed."  These terms are distinct, and they signal different ways for preprocessors to handle the ballot.

A DNS is a digital ballot that cannot be read by the digital scanner, generally due to damage such as tears, stains, etc.  Votes on DNS ballots must be counted by hand.  In reconciliation, the preprocessor counts the DNS ballots on the Ballot Count worksheet as processed ballots.  However, these DNS ballots must be stored in a separate envelope in the blue security case.

A "Not Processed" voter submission has incorrect or incomplete information on the B envelope thus presenting a material omission.  During reconciliation, the "Not Processed" voter submission is recorded in a separate column on the Ballot Count Worksheet.  It is separated from the batch and placed in the "Not Processed" table box.   

During reconciliation, keep in mind that DNS and "Not Processed" are recorded differently on the Ballot Count worksheet.
