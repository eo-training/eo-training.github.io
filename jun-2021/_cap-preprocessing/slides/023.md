title: "Matching Voter Information Label and B Envelope"
---

Before processing a ballot, you must ensure that the correct authorized absentee voter has completed the B envelope.  Therefore, it is very important that the voter’s name and address on the preprinted voter information label match the information provided by the voter on the B envelope.

Typically, the B envelope and the voter information label will contain the same voter information…but not always.

Note the example on the image.  According to the voter information label, Howard Fienberg is the authorized absentee voter.  A ballot was sent to Howard Fienberg.  However, it appears that the B envelope was completed by Julius Fienberg.

If you encounter this type of mismatch between the voter information label and the B envelope, do not process this ballot.  Place the mailer with all contents in the "Not Processed" table box.
