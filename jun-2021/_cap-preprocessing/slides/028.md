title: "UOCAVA Return Mailer"
---

The image shows a UOCAVA return mailer.  UOCAVA stands for Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act.  The UOCAVA return mailer will contain a special UOCAVA B envelope with a standard digital ballot inside.

A UOCAVA submission is sent to the Office of Elections by an authorized absentee voter who is living overseas or by military personnel living anywhere.

The UOCAVA mailer is similar to the domestic mailer.  It comes from the Office of Elections and has a CD color block on the upper edge.  The only difference is that the acronym "UOCAVA" appears on the front of the mailer in a white block at the top of the turquoise band.
