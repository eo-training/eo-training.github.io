title: "Why 10 in Batch?"

Why only 10?

Occasionally, during batch scanning, a "First Tuesday" server error message will pop up.  This screen indicates that one or more mailers in the batch just scanned may not have been saved in the database.  

If this screen appears, the entire batch must be rescanned.  

The "No More Than 10 Rule" was instituted to minimize the amount of time spent on rescanning.  

And a word of warning!  VERIS can be an unpredictable creature!  It can be slow or even unavailable at times.  Patience and flexibility will go a long way in helping you accomplish your job.
