title: "What is CAP Preprocessing?"
---

The overall objective of CAP Absentee is to fairly adjudicate the mail-in and drop box submissions of Fairfax County voters as well as to scrupulously account for their ballots and their votes.  Preprocessing is an integral element of this operation. 

In accordance with state law, authorized absentee voter submissions may be preprocessed (i.e. processed prior to election day). This procedure entails:  
1. evaluating voter submissions returned by mail or drop box  
2. checking voters into VERIS (the state-wide data base)
3. scanning ballots into a digital scanner.  

Preprocessing results are ultimately included in the Statement of Results (SOR) on election day. 

As an extended function of CAP, preprocessing reduces the workload for CAP Election Day officers and helps CAP produce accurate election results far more quickly than would otherwise be possible.
