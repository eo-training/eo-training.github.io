As we plan for and conduct each election, we follow four guiding principles to maintain the integrity of the election.  These principles inform each step and action we take.  

It is important for you, as members of the preprocessing staff, to read, understand, and embody these principles, to perform all duties assigned to you by the Office of Elections, and to do so faithfully, diligently, and impartially.
