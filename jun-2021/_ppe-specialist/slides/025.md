- Poll watchers must first check-in with the Chief Officer and receive a badge that authorizes them to be in the voting room during the day.
- Ensure poll watchers inside the voting room wear a face covering at all times. (poll watchers are required to bring their own face covering. Do **not** provide them with one from the election officer supplies.)
- Ensure poll watchers are at least 6 feet away from voters and election officers at all times.
- Ensure election officers speak in a clear and firm voice so they can be heard by poll watchers.
