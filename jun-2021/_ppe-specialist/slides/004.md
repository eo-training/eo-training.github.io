Let's first go over our Guiding Principles for Polling Places During COVID-19:

- We will do everything in our power to protect election officers, voters, political party observers, and everyone else in the polling places.
- We will ensure that every eligible voter in Fairfax County is able to vote in a fair, efficient, and equitable manner, balancing safety measures with the right to vote.
- We will use common sense, good judgement, and the knowledge that we have gained during the past year to implement safety measures that are practical and sensible.
