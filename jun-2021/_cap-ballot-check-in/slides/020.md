title: "Mailâ€™s in"

The mail is in.  We now begin the meat and potatoes part of our job; sorting, dating, counting and opening the return mailers; verification of B envelope name, address, and signature(s), and entry into the voter database, VERIS.

Two teams are tasked to accomplish this:  

 -  One team to sort, date, count and open the return mailers
 -  A second team to compare and verify info on the VERIS-generated voter information label against the voter-provided information on the B envelope, then to enter receipt of that return mailer into VERIS.  

Please note that assignments to either team will change periodically, as team workload is dependent on the amount of mail received each day.
