Welcome to Fairfax County Office of Elections, Central Absentee Precinct online training course for Managing Returned Ballots. This course is intended to guide the user through the procedures of receiving, processing, and recording receipt of voter return mailers containing absentee ballots into Virginiaâ€™s statewide database known as VERIS.  The training will also help you become familiar with process terminology, the different types of return mailers, their appearance and contents.   

Of note, during April, May, and June of 2021, we will be managing receipt of return mailers for two separate elections:

- Vienna town election thru 7 May
- Democratic primary thru 11 June 

**Extra care must be taken when sorting returned mail during this time to ensure received absentee ballots are counted towards the correct election.**
