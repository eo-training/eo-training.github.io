After confirming the Okta app request, you’ll see one of two screens: the **Notice and Warnings** screen or the **Election Secure Access Portal**.  If the **Warnings** screen pops up, go to the ***Log onto VERIS*** box in the lower right corner and click on your name.  This will take you to the VERIS homepage.  

If the **Election Secure Access Portal** screen comes up, click on the Election Secure Portal Access icon which takes you to the Warnings page. Once you get to the Warnings page, continuing logging in as above.  

You’re ready to begin checking in returned absentee ballot envelopes.
