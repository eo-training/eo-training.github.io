After applying for and receiving an absentee ballot at their home, the voter can still change their mind and not vote absentee but vote in person at a polling place or early voting location, or simply not vote at all.

In that case, the voter often will return the unopened A envelope to the Office of Elections.  Their unmarked ballot should still be inside the sealed A envelope.

You may also receive unmarked ballots in the original Office of Elections mailer as undeliverable mail by the post office.  This envelope is larger than the return mailers and will have a ***return to sender*** yellow sticker on the front of the envelope.
