title: "Voter Returned Mailers/B Envelopes…"

In addition to receiving mail from USPS and other commercial delivery services, we will also receive return mailers from early voting sites located throughout Fairfax County.  The return mailers from these locations are delivered to the Fairfax County Government Center, Office of Elections later in the day.  While they are sorted and counted in the same manner as mail delivered by USPS, FedEx, UPS, or DHL, these envelopes are tracked and accounted for separately.  It’s important to remember **to keep all mail received from these remote locations separate from USPS/other commercial delivered mail**.
