As the slide notes, the stability of the statewide database can be unpredictable at times.  Remember, VERIS is used across Virginia, not just within Fairfax County.  If there are a high number of users trying to access VERIS at the same time, thereâ€™s a possibility you could be kicked out of the system in the middle of an action, which in some cases would require you to restart your current work from the beginning.  

Patience and flexibility will go a long way in helping you accomplish your job.
